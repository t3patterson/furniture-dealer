George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Reduced Price 20% off Original Price Was $9,500","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","39.75” wide x 18.5” deep x 40.5” high","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent condition"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget.

Italy 1940 
Giancarlo Piretti`s folding chair Plia has become a part of design history. With its 3-disc hinge, ""Plia"" was influential in framing the term ""Italian Design"". More than six million have been sold since its introduction in 1969. Plia chairs have been exhibited in design exhibitions across the globe and it is also an exponent in the design department in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
The designer, who was born in Bologna in 1940, studied at the Instituto Statale d` Arte in his hometown. He later worked as an interior designer for Anonima Castelli and designed home furniture series, office furnishing systems and the legendary award-winning Plia chair. During his twelve with Castelli, he developed countless innovated furniture designs primarily in the field of chairs. 
From the late 1970s, he worked together with Emilio Ambasz on award-winning designs including two series of ergonomic seating systems, Vertebra und Dorsal. 
He introduced his Piretti Collection in 1988 at the NeoCon in Chicago, a series with over 50 different office chairs and seating ensembles. The special thing about them: the furniture has a patented mechanism on the backrest that allows the chairs to be adjusted to the weight of the user. This collection also won many prizes including the IBD (USA, 1989), the ASID (USA, 1990), the Compasso d`Oro (Italy, 1991) and the G-Mark (Japan, 1992). 
The legendary Plia chair belongs to the Castelli brand, a design institution that has been a member of the Haworth Group since 1992.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Castelli ""Plia"" Folding Chairs by Giancarlo Piretti

"Dansk Kobenstyle Red Dansk Enamel Bake Pan","MR9583","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Dansk International Designs Ltd. 
Over 60 years ago, Ted and Martha Nierenberg recognized Scandinavian design as the perfect vehicle for the new casual living style that was evolving in America after World War II. At the time, American architects and manufacturers were adapting a wide variety of new materials, technologies, and designs to the new postwar attitudes. No more separate dining rooms that relegated kitchens to workshops for food preparation. No more formal parties that required engraved invitations, fine linen, good china, and real silver. Americans wanted to gather for fun—for barbecues, fondue parties, and smorgasbords. The walls between cooking and dining were fading away – with more casual social interactions taking center stage. 
In 1953, the Nierenbergs were traveling in Europe in search of something that would address these burgeoning desires. In Scandinavian design they found elegant simplicity wrought from practical materials that could be furnished to the American market at reasonable prices. Through the early work of Danish designer Jens Quistgaard, they found beauty and intelligence that was both relevant and revered. Dansk was born.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","13"" Dansk Kobenstyle Red Dansk Enamel Bake Pan

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Blue Fabric Fiberglass Side Shell Chair and your Choice of Base

"Vintage De Sede Non Stop Leather Sofa Couch","MR9153","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","DE SEDE 
A brand makes history – de Sede has been shaping the world of furnishing for more than 40 years. 
All began with a small saddler’s workshop in Swiss Klingnau, close to the German border near Waldshut. In 1965, this family-run business became a joint-stock company thus giving birth to de Sede AG. The sophisticated designs of its leather furniture, all reflecting top-quality Swiss workmanship, swiftly gained the brand an international reputation. Additional manufacturing facilities were opened and the international distribution network developed still further. 
The rapidly expanding company called for new corporate structures. With its sale in 1984 to the concrete manufacturing company of PCW, the company’s orientation was corrected and a new management put in place. Information technology and controlling were expanded and from 1988 production was again concentrated in one location in Klingnau. New, unmistakeable products were created. 
In 1993, de Sede changed hands in a management buy-out by Hans-Peter Fässler and Bernhard Schüler. Six years later, came the acquisition of the German upholstered furniture manufacturer Hans Kaufeld in Bielefeld, while 2000 saw the takeover of a second German company, the seating manufacturer Frank Sitzmöbel. 
The de Sede product range is constantly being extended with work by renowned designers and the collection is nowadays hallmarked by the concept of multifunctional seating. Every year, de Sede presents its new models at the international furniture shows in Cologne and Milan.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ueli Berger, Eleanora Peduzzi-Riva and Heinz Ulrich","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","DE SEDE NON-STOP SOFA

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Black Bertoia Diamond Chairs Knoll International

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Signed HOLD","MR9553","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Miller Eames Aluminum Group Lounge Chair

"4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal SOLD","MR9550","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal Cube

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennetts projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Ward Bennett Channel Back Lounge Chairs

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9559","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.

Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Leather and Stainless Steel Sofa

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal HOLD","MR9554","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

The Taito metal art firm was established in 1919, with Ehrström as one of its partners and head of its applied art department. The other partners in the venture were the sculptor Emil Wikström, the industrialist Gösta Serlachius and the metal craftsman and designer Paavo Tynell.

Thomas Industries was formed in a 1953 merger of two companies--a lighting fixture manufacturer and the maker of electrical spraying machines--both of which came into being in the late 1920s. The unlikely marriage of these two product lines was the cornerstone of what would become the company`s two core businesses: lighting fixtures and air compressors/pumps. 
The lighting fixture side of Thomas Industries traces its history back to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and two brothers: Henrik and Ole Moe.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Moe Light: 
The Moe Brothers, together with a number of other entrepreneurs, owned the Moe-Bridges Co., a lighting fixture manufacturer formed in 1919. As a result of friction among the Moe-Bridges management, however, the Moe brothers were frozen out of the company in the late 1920s by the majority owners. Deciding to stay with the industry they knew, the Moes formed another lighting fixture company called Moe Brothers Manufacturing. Henrik`s two sons joined the business in the early 1930s, and in 1938, the company moved its operations from Milwaukee to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","1950’s Moe Pull Down Brass Ceiling Lamp with Spot Light","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","22"" Diameter

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage. 
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Fritz Hansen Series 7 Task Chair by Arne Jacobsen

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","78"" Jens Risom Mid Century Modern Kneehole Credenza

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames For Herman Miller Lounge Chair And Ottoman

(1886 - 1962) 
Born in Prague, Frankl together with his fellow European Joseph Urban, was one of the pioneering Modern designers working in America before 1925, who laid the foundations of the American tradition of modern decoration. After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Paul Frankl Mahogany ""Bell"" End Tables

Born in este (Padua, Italy) in 1940. In 1966 he received his degree in architecture from the University of Florence, and as soon as he graduated, he founded the radical Archizoom association studio, with Andrea Branzi, Gilberto Corretti, Massimo Morozzi, and later joined by Dario and Lucia Bartolini. Archizoom was polemical in speech and practice in a period of social radicalism . Numerous projects and essays reflected 
the group’s search for a new approach to urban design and product design. 
He worked with this florentine studio until it closed in 1972. Since then he worked independently in Milan. He developed industrial design projects, mainly furniture, for italian companies such as Cassina, Driade, Zanotta… Deganello has taken part in international exhibitions, including: ‘radical architecture’ (1967), ‘design by circumstances, episodes in italian architecture 1962 - 1980,’ in New York; ‘the triennale`s homes’ at the Milan Triennale (1984); ‘Nouvelles Tendances’ at Paris`s Centre Pompidou (1987); and ‘Documenta 9’ in Kassel, Germany (1987). A one-man show was staged at Amsterdam`s galerie (1988), at the Japan Design Committee in Tokyo (1991)and at CAC in Cantu (2002) from 1991 he teaches industrial design at Isia in Florence.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Cassina 654 Torso by Paolo Deganello Chaise Lounge","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","57” length x 41.7” deep x 45.7” Height

Since 1860 
In post-war 1950 Antoine’s grandson, Jean, quickly shifted the focus of the company- which now employed 50 people-to contract furniture. Tables, chairs and beds were produced for commercial usage and were utilized in a variety of institutions, including schools, universities, hospitals and retirement homes. Intense growth soon followed and, 10 years later, Jean Roset entered the domestic market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Pascal Mourgue 
Pascal Mourgue is above all else an artist. He graduated from Boulle school (sculpture) and Ensad (Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs). 
He began designing furniture in 1962, while continuing to be a prolific artist. Never openly seeking publicity, Pascal Mourgue has always prized artistic integrity above commercial achievement. This love of art has led him to work in fields as diverse as designing sailing boats for Cartier, crystal objects for Baccarat, architecture, painting and sculpture. It was not until the 1980s that he focused on furniture for the home. 
In 1994, a long standing and very fruitful collaboration was born between Pascal Mourgue and Ligne Roset.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pascal Mourgue Ligne Roset Smala Sofa Bed & Ottoman

Made in Brazil","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Sergio Rodrigues (1927-) Brazil 
Architect & Designer 
Sergio Rodrigues became a great furniture designer, to the point of receiving an entry in the Encyclopaedia Delta Larousse presenting him as ""Sergio Rodrigues, creator of the Brazilian furniture."" In fact, he broke paradigms in his activity. He distinguishes himself by his own language, which made the search for Brazilian identity one of its aims. 
He founded, in 1955, the `Oca Industry`. The name defines an intention: to recapture the spirit of simplicity of the indigenous house, to integrate past and present in Brazilian material culture. `Oca` was created as a studio of interior design, decoration, set design and decorative components combined with an art gallery and an exhibition of furniture designed by him. He left the company in 1968, and since then has been working in his practice developing furniture lines for industrial production; architecture and interior decoration projects for hotels, residences and offices; and prefabricated housing systems. 
Rodrigues has undertaken an infinity of special furniture projects, amongst others for the Brazilian Embassy in Rome, the University of Brasilia, the Arches Palace, the National Theatre in Brasilia and the headquarters of Bloch Publishers. Amongst other exhibitions, he participated in the show Convegno Brasile 93, La Construzione de una Identita Culturale, in Brescia, Italy, together with Lucio Costa and Zanine Caldas; in the Architecture Biennial in Sao Paulo; and in `Tradico e Ruptura` (tradition and rupture). He was given the Lapiz de Plata Award at the Architecture Biennial in Buenos Aires for his work as a group collection.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Rosewood Armchairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.5"" width x 22"" depth x 28.5"" height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Management Chair

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","New Barcelona Ottoman

1922-2003 
Innovative designer and successful entrepreneur, Brooklyn-born Harvey Probber transformed the look of American furniture at mid-century. Known for his sleek modern lines and flexible modular units, Probber left an indelible stamp on the living rooms and dens of American families. The furniture he designed and produced for 40 years at his factory, Harvey Probber, Inc., first in New York and later in Fall River, Massachusetts, was elegant, up-to-date and beautifully adapted to the mobile, casual TV lifestyles that emerged in the U.S. during the post-World War II decades. 
Since Probber’s death in March of 2003, a re-evaluation of his design work and his influence on 20 th_ century style has begun. 
A self-taught modernist, Probber had virtually no artistic training when, at the age of 16, he designed his first piece—a sofa. “The key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry,” was how he characterized the source of his early inspirations. And it was those bits and pieces that led him to create the upholstered modular seating units that became a furniture industry phenomenon in the 1940s. Probber’s output, however, included much more, including the elegant sling-back chair displayed by MoMA as well as numerous tables and storage units. Later in his career, Probber turned his attention to office furniture, where his influence was as pervasive as it was in home design. Probber modified the severely functional modernist look by his use of fine fabrics, laminated surfaces and tribal-influenced woven materials. “Functional is not nearly enough,” was Probber’s credo. 
A creative force in modern design, Probber also knew what would sell and never forgot the needs of his customers.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","78"" Jens Risom Mid Century Modern Desk

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9562","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9561","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","48"" Herman Miller Nelson Platform Bench 

Introduced in 1946, the Nelson platform bench remains a landmark of modern design. The clean, rectilinear lines reflect designer George Nelson`s architectural background and his insistence on what he called ""honest"" design - making an honest visual statement about an object`s purpose. The bench serves as a multipurpose display and resting place in offices, public areas, and homes.

"Rare Eames Herman Miller Rope Edge Zenith Shell Chair","MR9276","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Charles and Ray Eames

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Eames Herman Miller Rope Edge Zenith Shell Chair

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Original Bertoia Full Diamond Chair CUSHION only

The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of (6) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

Her lounge seating, sofas, tables, and storage adapt flawlessly to any environment, with their clean, linear design and incredibly durable, high-quality construction.

Not flashy pieces at all, Knoll said that her own work ""filled in the gaps"" for star pieces by Bertoia and Saarinen, but today we know that they stand in a class all by themselves.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Florence Knoll Walnut Credenza

"(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9565","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Chrome Milo Baughman Arm Chairs

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Knoll Bertoia Full Cushion and Black Diamond Chair  1952 Design

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Burled Olivewood and Chrome Buffet

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Knoll Marcel Breuer Leather Wassily Chair

The seat and the back are made from canvas , fabric or leather. It was designed for Kandinsky`s quarters at the Dessau Bauhaus. It was at the time quite revolutionary in its use of tubular steel. It was inspired by an Adler bike~

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Wire Side Occassional Table

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

The new loomed woven fabric meant that a chair could be produced in a quarter of the time it took to make a rattan or wicker version. The end product was not only more beautiful but much more durable, as well. 
In America, Mr. Lloyd`s product became quite famous. His company was merged with Heywood-Wakefield, who went out of business in the 1980s.
The British Invasion
In Europe, the manufacturer in London purchased the rights and specialized equipment from Lloyd Manufacturing in 1921 and became hugely successful. But having been bombed in WWII, and the necessary materials for production unavailable due to the War effort, the company never recovered and discontinued operations in 1960. 
Over the years, Lloyd Loom British Woven Fibre Furniture has been seen on ocean liners, in hotels and tearooms; it became standard issue for the British Army and RAF all over the world; it even graced the Royal Boxes at Wimbledon, Henley and Twickenham and is often seen ""keeping the British end up"" at Royal functions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Alfons Bach

The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 7"" Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Sculpture

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Management Chair Dark Orange Upholstery

1954 
G-Plan was a pioneering range of furniture in the United Kingdom, produced by E Gomme Ltd. Launched in 1954 and backed by consumer advertising, G-Plan was sold direct to the public via showrooms and exhibitions which displayed the furniture in room sets - the first use of lifestyle marketing in Britain - rather than through traditional furniture shops. In another first, G-Plan was designed to be mixed and matched, and - another novelty in the post-World War II era - was also modern and affordable. As Scandinavian designs gained popularity, a Danish-designed range was added in the early-1960s. The success of G-Plan lead to E Gomme becoming one of the UK`s largest furniture manufacturers.

BAKHTIARI rugs are named for the BAKHTIARI tribe, one of the most ancient and well-known Persian tribes, found in the area southwest of Isfahan. 
This formerly nomadic tribe, of which Sorayawas perhaps the most famous daughter, has since become settled. 
After they established a settlement in the the Zagros region of the Chahar-Mahal area, their production of carpets increased at the start of the 19th century. This region is known for having very luxurious wool that produces excellent carpets. The center of the BAKHTIARI weaving area is now southeast of Isfahan in Shahr-Kurd, and rugs of lesser quality are known by their place of manufacture, such as Bibibaff, Saman, and Luri. 
There are nearly 200 villages in this area today, which produce some of the most charming carpets available on the market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","135"" Length x 75"" Width","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","12 Herman Miller Time Life Office Executive Chairs

Deep Cushions and Padded Arms

Originally designed in 1960 for the lobby of the Time-Life Building in New York, this padded leather swivel chair is also known as the ""Bobby Fischer,"" because he used it in the World Chess Championship in Reykjavik in 1972. Chess master Bobby Fisher insisted on settling into one of these chairs while he competed in the World Chess Championship in Reykjavik. When his opponent, Boris Spassky, admired it Herman Miller had one flown in for the Russian chess master as well.

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina.
Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Tobia Scarpa Andre Low Coffee Table

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 
From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 
In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Set of Three Alvar Aalto Stacking Stools

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity.""

"(1) 5"" Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9586","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 5"" Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Sculpture

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Bertoia Full Cover Cushion","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Fits a Bird chair

Designer Gilbert Rohde (1894-1944) was born and raised in New York, the son of a cabinetmaker. Inspired by a trip to the Paris Exhibition in 1925, Rohde began designing furniture and his early work was sold at Lord & Taylor. An exuberant modernist, his pieces gleaned simplicity and rationalism from Bauhaus design and a sense of form and ornamentation from Art Deco. He worked predominantly in Bakelite and chrome, the materials that made up the visual vocabulary of the period.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Art Deco Machine Age Gilbert Rohde Desk & Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Desk: 42"" Length x 16"" Depth x 30.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good original vintage.

"(1) 8"" Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9587","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 8"" Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Sculpture

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Van Der Rohe Brno Chair 
The first and still the most elegant of its kind, the Brno Chair by Mies van der Rohe is a masterpiece of structure. Designed in 1930 for the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Brilliance of form and function shown in the construction of these chairs represents the beginnings of an intensely creative period in architecture known as the ""Bauhaus"" period.

"Wicker and Chrome Ward Bennet Sled Lounge Chair","MR9837","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett
Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ward Bennett ""Sled Chair""

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Burled Olivewood and Chrome Buffet with Marble Top

In 1984, Irving M. Rosen, a founder of Pace Furniture, purchased the company. He brought his unique experience in design and furniture manufacturing to creating a new generation of Cumberland furnishings. Rosen supplemented existing pieces with contemporary designs from European designers. 
Scott F. Gilmore of S. F. Gilmore, Inc., in Grand Rapids, Michigan, purchased Cumberland in 1998. After a period of reorganization, Gilmore has brought Cumberland into a new era that expands Cumberland’s strengths and reputation while keeping its heritage in clear view. 
Between 1998 and 2002, Scott and his staff brought the Cumberland product line in-house and worked to restore the heritage of the Cumberland name by modifying and reproducing the company’s old designs. In 2003, Cumberland Furniture partnered with Gary Lee Partners, a respected Chicago-based design firm, to restore the sophistication of the Cumberland product line.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Vintage Cumberland Pace Collection","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","26"" width x 28"" depth x 39"" height

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Van Der Rohe Brno Chairs

The first and still the most elegant of its kind, the Brno Chair by Mies van der Rohe is a masterpiece of structure. Designed in 1930 for the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Brilliance of form and function shown in the construction of these chairs represents the beginnings of an intensely creative period in architecture known as the ""Bauhaus"" period.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(12) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Management Chairs Set

"(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9569","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dunbar Plateau Table by Edward Wormley

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Rare Lounge Leather Chair by Milo Baughman","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" width x 26"" depth x 30"" height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Norman Cherner studied and taught at the Columbia University Fine Arts Department and was an instructor at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from 1947 to 1949. At the same time he also began his practice, embarking on a lifetime exploration of multidisciplinary design. 

Although best known for his furniture design, his work included almost all aspects of design: from graphics, glassware and lighting, to his pioneering work in prefabricated housing. 

Having been educated in the Bauhaus tradition, he became interested in housing as industrial design. His first houses were built in 1948 for a cooperative in Ramapo, NY. These homes were examples of this total design concept and included affordable furniture designed specifically for these low-cost modular dwellings.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","2 Vintage Norman Cherner Plycraft Bent Wood Chairs

"9.5"" Sergio Bustamante Bronze Eclipse Statue","MR9635","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Sergio Bustamante

Since the 1960’s, Sergio Bustamante has been internationally recognized in the world of creative arts and crafts. His work encompasses a variety of art forms, including paper mâché, ceramics and bronze. Recent innovations include distinctive lines of fine jewelry and beautifully crafted furniture, but he is primarily known for his sculpture. 
Though born in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, of both Chinese and Indian ancestry, Sergio Bustamante has lived in the Guadalajara area since early childhood. In his youth, he studied architecture at the University of Guadalajara, but abandoned this pursuit when his talents and interests drew him to the fine arts and crafts of his native land. 
Bustamante`s creations reflect a uniquely imaginative individuality, style and creativity distinct from - though often copied by - other artists, making his works much desired by art aficionados worldwide. 
He began with paintings and paper mâché figures, inaugurating the first exhibit of his works at the Galeria Misracha in Mexico City in 1966. In the early 1970`s, he traveled to Amsterdam, where he further developed his talents. After his return to Guadalajara in 1975, he established, along with other artists, the ""Family Workshop Studio"" in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, Mexico. 
Bustamante`s work is a marriage of the colors and forms of his native Mexico, with an inspiration and imagination that are entirely his own. His artistic sensibility successfully combines familiar and popular imagery with the surreal. Bustamante is an artisan - and in true artisan style, he has mastered his various mediums, as well as his chosen subject matter. 
Above all, he is known for being the author of his own universe of forms and figures. He has excelled as a painter , molder and designer, without renouncing his essential thematic obsessions. With differing aesthetic intentions, he has created a uniquely wonderful iconography that is profoundly significant, beautiful, and affecting. He continues to explore uncharted paths in the New Millennium, and is considered one of the greatest Mexican artists of our time.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Sergio Bustamante Bronze Statue Numbered 45/100

"Vintage Industrial Age GF Executive Aluminum Chair","MR9263","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 
The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage General Fireproofing Executive Aluminum Chair

Norman Cherner studied and taught at the Columbia University Fine Arts Department and was an instructor at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from 1947 to 1949. At the same time he also began his practice, embarking on a lifetime exploration of multidisciplinary design. 
Although best known for his furniture design, his work included almost all aspects of design: from graphics, glassware and lighting, to his pioneering work in prefabricated housing. 
Having been educated in the Bauhaus tradition, he became interested in housing as industrial design. His first houses were built in 1948 for a cooperative in Ramapo, NY. These homes were examples of this total design concept and included affordable furniture designed specifically for these low-cost modular dwellings.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Vintage Norman Cherner Plycraft","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18"" width x 22.5"" depth x 32"" height

"(1) Herman Miller Hollington Leather Low Back Task Chair","MR9575","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Geoff Hollington 
Geoff Hollington picks up his fresh, black Edding 55 fibre-tip pen and draws a little square in the top right corner of a clean, white sheet of A4-size copier paper. The square will enclose the date, the project code, and the sheet number for his next design. Creating the square is a ritual that redefines the paper as a field for ideas. Repeated for countless sheets of unmarked A4-sized copier paper, the ritual itself becomes the first step of each design. 
The ritual is characteristic of Hollington`s attention to details. He thinks about how the handle will feel when a person opens a drawer on a Relay desk. He knows what he wants a person to experience when they use any of the Relay line of products available from Herman Miller for the Home. Geoff encourages a sense of surprise and discovery in those who see and use his products. He expects a person slipping for the first time into the Hollington executive chair, also available from Herman Miller for the Home, to say, `Yes, of course, this is how a chair should feel.` 
Hollington studied design at the Royal College of Art in London in the early 1970s and shortly afterward `discovered` Herman Miller and the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames. `If you asked me, way back, what`s the one company in the world I`d really like to work for, it would have been Herman Miller,` he says. 
His hands come up to carve a rectangle out of the air as he describes the designer`s challenge of creating a humane environment for work. `In the 1960s and 1970s, we tended to think of offices as factories or laboratories. We`re moving into a time when we think of offices as places where we can be creative.` 
It is this approach to design that makes his designs as appropriate for the home as for the office. 
Hollington`s desk is littered with used Edding 55 pens that no longer draw fine lines. He readily tosses copier paper into the bin. The paper, in fact, has commodity status, he says. No brand is perfect. Ideas are tried and rejected. It is the ritual.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Hollington Task Chair with Low Back and Leather","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","26"" Width x 21"" Depth x 37.5"" Max.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","27"" Jens Risom Mid Century Modern","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","27"" length x 20"" depth x 26.5"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 
From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 
In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Serving Cart Designed by Alvar Aalto for Artek

"4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal","MR9551","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Blue/Gray Fiberglass Side Shell Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18.5 inch Wide x 22 inch Deep x 31 3/8 inch High

"13`x 9` Bakhtiari kheshis Iran Handmade Persian Rug","MR9649","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","13` x 9` Bakhtiari Iran Red Black Handmade Persian Rug

Red, black background with blue, yellow and green details
Type: Rug
Design: Bakhtiari kheshis
Material: Wool
Origin: Iran
Retail price: $16,995.00

BAKHTIARI rugs are named for the BAKHTIARI tribe, one of the most ancient and well-known Persian tribes, found in the area southwest of Isfahan. 
This formerly nomadic tribe, of which Sorayawas perhaps the most famous daughter, has since become settled. 
After they established a settlement in the the Zagros region of the Chahar-Mahal area, their production of carpets increased at the start of the 19th century. This region is known for having very luxurious wool that produces excellent carpets. The center of the BAKHTIARI weaving area is now southeast of Isfahan in Shahr-Kurd, and rugs of lesser quality are known by their place of manufacture, such as Bibibaff, Saman, and Luri. 
There are nearly 200 villages in this area today, which produce some of the most charming carpets available on the market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","13.04"" Length x 9.07"" Width","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Hand weaving of Persian carpets and kilims has been an important element of the tribal crafts of many of the subregions of modern day Iran. Examples of carpet types are the Lavar Kerman carpet from Kerman and the Seraband rug from Arak. 
An important innovation in weaving that was developed in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age was the introduction of foot pedals to operate a loom. The first such devices appeared in Syria, Iran and Islamic parts of East Africa, where ""the operator sat with his feet in a pit below a fairly low-slung loom."" By 1177, it was further developed in Al-Andalus, where having the mechanism was ""raised higher above the ground on a more substantial frame."" This type of loom spread to the Christian parts of Spain and soon became popular all over medieval Europe.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","53"" Length x 26"" Width x 68.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Bertoia Fiberglass Shell Bar Stool

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Barcelona Ottoman

American furniture designer, born Kansas, and active California and Utah. Baughman’s family moved to Long Beach, California in the mid 1920s. 
A highly creative child, he was given carte blanche at age 13 to design the new family home. Baughman served in the Air Force during World War II, and also designed officer`s clubs. After the war, he studied architecture and product design at the Art Center School of Los Angeles, and the California School of the Arts. 
His training complete, Baughman took a job with the Frank Brothers department store, an emporium noted for its design focus. He worked as a salesman and a window dresser; on the side, he became involved with the influential publication Furniture Forum. His growing reputation soon attracted furniture manufacturer Glenn of California, which hired Baughman to design a new collection. Working mainly with walnut, formica and wrought iron, Baughman created simple, understated pieces; many were conceived as space dividers, functioning admirably in the open plan interiors characteristic of the California Modern style. 
After briefly running his own workshop, Baughman began a long and fruitful association in 1953 with Thayer Coggin, a North Carolina furniture company. His accessibly stylish furniture proved very popular with middle class consumers, and he quickly became a household name. He has designed hundreds of pieces for Thayer Coggin to date; among the noteworthy are the 820-400 chaise (1954), the leather and chrome 951-103 arm chair (1962), and the Shelter sofa (1967). 
Baughman`s work was included in the Whitney Museum`s 1985 exhibit ""High Styles: Twentieth Century American Design"". In recognition of his monumental impact on American taste, Baughman was inducted into the Furniture Designers Hall of Fame in 1987. Today, he directs the Environmental Design Department at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Chrome Octagonal","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","40"" diameter x 16"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","very good vintage

"Early Herman Miller Shell Lounge Chair","MR9684","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Charles and Ray Eames

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9557","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

"1998 Round Gaetano Pesce ""Try"" Tray Fish Design","MR9463","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gaetano Pesce 

The architect Gaetano Pesce was born in 1939 in La Spezia, Italy. He attended the school of Architecture of Venice from 1958 to 1963. He has lived in many European cities – Padua, Venice, London, Helsinki, Paris – and since 1980, in New York. His multidisciplinary work is present in the permanent collections of Museums in France, Finland, the United States, England, Portugal and Italy. Gaetano Pesce has been teaching for twenty-six years at the École d’Architecture de Strasbourg and has lectured in the most prominent Universities and Cultural Institutions around the world. He has worked in France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United States, Brazil and Belgium. Pesce’s works are often memorable for their ability to give an unexpected twist to favorite themes: the “diversified series”, the twin functionality of objects and architecture, the creative use of colour, the political dimension of the project, the theory and practice of the “poorly executed”, the use and development of synthetic materials, the theory of the “femininity” of architectural projects and the “culture of objects”.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","A round Gaetano Pesce “Try” tray from 1998 Fish Design Collection. 
A one of a kind piece in cast resin. 

Fish design is a collection of pieces designed by Gaetano Pesce, an architect, artist, & designer. unique objects, each one different from the next, are the concept that encapsulates the fish design philosophy. The creativity of the crafts person, the unpredictability of the fluids, and the opportunity to insert variables â€“ from choice of color to distribution of materials are some of the paths to obtaining the diversity and uniqueness of a fish design object. The choice of materials is an essential element and the use of fluid, dynamic, variable, & expressive resins was not a casual choice. Plastic materials represent the idea of the future for Gaetano Pesce and have offered him the opportunity to innovate and search for a new concept of beauty. 

Part of the historical collection 1995, the try trays are cast in solid resin. Bears the fish design logo and year of production.

"(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9568","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Round Platner Wire Dining Table Base","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","34"" Diameter x 27.5"" High","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","8ft Herman Miller Leather Aluminum Nelson Base Bench

Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Management Chair Orange Upholstery 
1958 Design 
The Aluminum Group chairs were originally developed in 1958 as a special project by Charles and Ray Eames for a private residence being designed by Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard. The seat-back suspension was a major technical achievement and represented a departure from the concept of the chair as a solid shell.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Bertoia Bird Lounge Chair and Ottoman

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Laccio Marcel Breuer Tubular Steel Table

Since 1860 
In post-war 1950 Antoine’s grandson, Jean, quickly shifted the focus of the company- which now employed 50 people-to contract furniture. Tables, chairs and beds were produced for commercial usage and were utilized in a variety of institutions, including schools, universities, hospitals and retirement homes. Intense growth soon followed and, 10 years later, Jean Roset entered the domestic market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Michael Koenig 
Michael was born in Aachen in 1971, to a Dutch mother and a German father. He grew up in the part of Germany which borders the Netherlands and Belgium. Michael`s grandfathers were skilled craftsmen, so he became acquainted with all kinds of materials at an early age and loved making and creating all kinds of things. 
After school Michael trained to become a cabinet maker. He studied design in Aachen, where he gained an honours degree. One year later, at the age of 27, he started work as a lecturer at the University of Aachen, teaching product development. 
During this time Michael started work on his own projects with small German design labels such as Details and Freiraum. After his first booklet mailing in 1999, Michael came to the attention of Habitat and Ligne Roset. These were the first major international companies he worked for, and they have remained loyal clients. 
For several years now, Michael has had his own studio in Hamburg, where he moved to after starting a family.

BAKHTIARI rugs are named for the BAKHTIARI tribe, one of the most ancient and well-known Persian tribes, found in the area southwest of Isfahan. 
This formerly nomadic tribe, of which Sorayawas perhaps the most famous daughter, has since become settled. 
After they established a settlement in the the Zagros region of the Chahar-Mahal area, their production of carpets increased at the start of the 19th century. This region is known for having very luxurious wool that produces excellent carpets. The center of the BAKHTIARI weaving area is now southeast of Isfahan in Shahr-Kurd, and rugs of lesser quality are known by their place of manufacture, such as Bibibaff, Saman, and Luri. 
There are nearly 200 villages in this area today, which produce some of the most charming carpets available on the market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","13.04"" Length x 9.07"" Width","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Walnut Dining Table by Arne Jacobsen","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","35"" diameter x 28"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Children Desk

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Knoll Platner Lounge Chair

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Tobia Scarpa Low Table Base","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","45"" Length x 45"" Width x 15"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edward Wormley for Dunbar Tambour Door","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","48"" Length x 14.5"" Depth x 14"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent: Nearly showroom perfect"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Light Gray Fiberglass Side Shell Chair

G-Plan was a pioneering range of furniture in the United Kingdom, produced by E Gomme Ltd. Launched in 1954 and backed by consumer advertising, G-Plan was sold direct to the public via showrooms and exhibitions which displayed the furniture in room sets - the first use of lifestyle marketing in Britain - rather than through traditional furniture shops. In another first, G-Plan was designed to be mixed and matched, and - another novelty in the post-World War II era - was also modern and affordable. As Scandinavian designs gained popularity, a Danish-designed range was added in the early-1960s. The success of G-Plan lead to E Gomme becoming one of the UK`s largest furniture manufacturers.

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Chrome Sofa Couch by Milo Baughman

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget.

"1930 Gilbert Rohde Troy Sunshade Chrome Chair","MR9109","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The Troy Sunshade Co.
The history of company dates back to 1887 when two Troy, Ohio businessmen (Frank Douglas and Gus Stouder) discovered the first carriage sunshade. These sunshades were being made by a local preacher under his patent. The young businessmen acquired the rights to manufacture the sun shades and paid the preacher at a rate of six cents each, and business was born. 
1931 During the Great Depression, company developed a new enterprise - ""Chrome Furniture"". By the mid-thirties sales had increased to such a level that two large mills were installed to make the steel tubing on site. 
1950 After the war, company returned to manufacturing regular line of products, greatly expanding our furniture operations. New lines were introduced including booths and tables for restaurants, dinette sets for homes and chair settees for offices. 
1970 Furniture business was sold to Gleason Corporation of Milwaukee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gilbert Rohde 
(American, 1894-1944) 
Designer Gilbert Rohde was born and raised in New York, the son of a cabinetmaker. He left high school to pursue a variety of jobs, landing a short stint at a local paper, the Bronx News, drawing political cartoons. In 1923 he turned the experience into a job as an illustrator at the Abraham & Strauss department store. Inspired by a trip to the Paris Exhibition in 1925, Rohde began designing furniture and his early work was sold at Lord & Taylor. An exuberant modernist, his pieces gleaned simplicity and rationalism from Bauhaus design and a sense of form and ornamentation from Art Deco. He worked predominantly in Bakelite and chrome, the materials that made up the visual vocabulary of the period. 
Between 1927-28 Rohde designed the interiors for Avedon fashion stores, where his wife was part of the advertising team. Heywood-Wakefield of Massachusetts began picking up his designs in 1930, with a bentwood chair being one of their most successful pieces. Restless for a more substantial opportunity, he went west to Grand Rapids, Michigan where companies like John Widdicomb and Herman Miller had turned the city into a hub of furniture design and manufacturing. Rohde attracted the interest of Herman Miller and began designing for them in 1931. The company had been making traditional pieces and historical reproductions and was close to bankruptcy when they accepted Rohde`s modern work in a last ditch attempt to stay afloat. Apparently the miracle they needed, Rohde convinced them that modernism was the reigning style and proved it with his designs for bedroom furniture shown at the 1933 Chicago World`s Fair. Fortified by their updated image, Herman Miller had Rohde design entire sets for living and dining rooms and began making plans to halt their production of traditional pieces. Rohde designed a popular line of modular office furniture for Herman Miller, and they would later reintroduce the bentwood chair he made for Heywood-Wakefield. He also acted as the Design Director for several years. 
During his tenure with Herman Miller Rohde was also pursuing a number of outside projects. He made a line of chrome chairs for the Troy Sunshade Company in 1933 and also worked some with Thonet. His designs were exhibited at the show of Machine Art at the MoMA in 1934 as well as at the Art and Industry show inside New York`s RCA building. In 1939 he exhibited work at the New York World`s Fair. He acted as the director of the Design Laboratory, also in New York, from 1935-38, and was the head of industrial design at the NYU School of Architecture from 1939-43.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","1930 Gilbert Rohde Troy Sunshade Chrome Chair

The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

"Vintage Sergio Rodrigues Stendig Mole Seating Settee","MR9662","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","STENDIG","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Sergio Rodrigues 

Sergio Rodrigues is the figure of illuminated characters, which has transformed its concerns in a consistent and eloquent work of Brazilian culture. Sergio is undoubtedly one of the most admirable expressions of design in our country. The single trait consistent and put your name in the history of 20th century design, especially the creation of a wide variety of products, the most famous is the Armchair Mole.
Next to masters like Jose Joaquim Tenreiro and Zanine Caldas, Sergio is making the Brazilian designer known internationally. While Tenreiro, with its mobile sober, was the forerunner in the search for a new style, Zanine wood pulled all of its expressive potential and Sergio Rodrigues has a wide experience in production, trying to think Brazil by design. He completely transformed the language of the mobile, was generous in the dash and the employment of native woods and, as well Lucio Costa said, ""with the creation of the OCA has the ambiance of the interior movement of renewal of our architecture."" 
The Brazilian production in this sector (furniture) in the mid-50s, was still prey to the very styles, and its renewal require two battles. Sergio knew that the only weapon that it was the design and that there was gone. 
Initially, as architect, worked alongside David Dobson, Flavio Regis do Nascimento and Olaf Redig Field project in the Civic Center in Curitiba, significant work in the context of modern Brazilian architecture. But, knowing their interests vigorously and trails for a path for other great architects like John Vilanova Artigas, Oscar Niemeyer, Oswaldo Bratke and Paulo Mendes da Rocha, Sergio jumped from architecture to the design of the mobile. 
Moreover, he was absolutely convinced that the ""architecture in the planning of internal space was not adequately studied architecture was not, it was sculpture."" 
For Lucio Costa, in some parts Sergio Rodrigues succeeded redeem the spirit of traditional furniture and also aspects of indigenous Australia. ""In fact, at that time he did the Brazil-Brazilian co-exist with Brazil-de-Ipanema, sung later (1962) by Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Morais in the famous"" Girl from Ipanema, ""and with Brazil`s Sao Paulo industrialization, Oca was actually the representative of selected models of the main factories of Sao Paulo. "" That is why the name Oca: a return to indigenous sources, the taste for traditional materials. Sergio immediately launched a search for permanent projects, methods and materials to meet adequately the needs of the user, unrelated to fashions and styles. According to Oscar Niemeyer: ""At that time (beginning of Brasilia) have not had time to think about designing mobile no. We use current mobile market, selecting the Palace as required. The main furniture designer who was asked Sergio Rodriguez."" At activities in the sector of furniture is fundamental to highlight the work of Sergio in the planning of interiors, the ambience, the scenery and decoration. Within the interior, cooperating with the most important architects Brazilians, and in his own store - The Oca - provided various consultancy in the country and abroad legitimizing the ""interior design"" in Brazil. 
""The accuracy of the mobile modern design with certain objects of Brazilian culture, and not concerned about fashions, accentuating the spirit of Brazilian Sergio Rodrigues that both search. These two facts were clear from the jury`s decision of the Fourth Biennial of Mobile, Cantu, Italy 1961, winning with the Sheriff Armchair between 400 candidates from 35 countries.

(1925-)
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Milo Baughman Burl Chrome Coffee Table

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage. 
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Fritz Hansen Series 7 Teak Side Chairs by Arne Jacobsen

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

"(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9567","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Sculpture Crystal

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Time Life Office Executive Chair

"58"" Mid Century Harvey Probber Freestanding Unit","MR9791","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Harvey Probber Inc","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Harvey Probber 
1922-2003 
Innovative designer and successful entrepreneur, Brooklyn-born Harvey Probber transformed the look of American furniture at mid-century. Known for his sleek modern lines and flexible modular units, Probber left an indelible stamp on the living rooms and dens of American families. The furniture he designed and produced for 40 years at his factory, Harvey Probber, Inc., first in New York and later in Fall River, Massachusetts, was elegant, up-to-date and beautifully adapted to the mobile, casual TV lifestyles that emerged in the U.S. during the post-World War II decades. 
Since Probber’s death in March of 2003, a re-evaluation of his design work and his influence on 20 th_ century style has begun. 
A self-taught modernist, Probber had virtually no artistic training when, at the age of 16, he designed his first piece—a sofa. “The key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry,” was how he characterized the source of his early inspirations. And it was those bits and pieces that led him to create the upholstered modular seating units that became a furniture industry phenomenon in the 1940s. Probber’s output, however, included much more, including the elegant sling-back chair displayed by MoMA as well as numerous tables and storage units. Later in his career, Probber turned his attention to office furniture, where his influence was as pervasive as it was in home design. Probber modified the severely functional modernist look by his use of fine fabrics, laminated surfaces and tribal-influenced woven materials. “Functional is not nearly enough,” was Probber’s credo. 
A creative force in modern design, Probber also knew what would sell and never forgot the needs of his customers. A popularizer as well as an innovator, he never strayed too far into the realm of the theoretical, one reason his work did not always receive the acclaim it deserved.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","66"" Vintage Mid Century Modern Harvey Probber Freestanding Unit","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","58"" Length x 13.75"" Depth x 55.75"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of (6) Herman Miller Shell Arm Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","32"" Height X 25"" Width X 23"" Depth

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Chrome Base Console Table

"(1) 8"" Block Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9566","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke 
After studies in industrial design at the College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, which included winning a coveted Orrefors scholarship year in 1982, Erika Lagerbielke committed her special talents to the company. For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Office Chairs by Warren Platner for Steelcase","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","28"" width x 28"" depth x 37"" height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Eames Blue Upholstery Fiberglass Side Shell Chair with your Choice of Base 1950

Mathieu Matégot was born in Hungary in 1910
After his studies at the school of fine arts and architecture in Budapest, he began to create sets for the National Theater. He settled in France in 1931, where he took up various professions, creating sets for the Folies Bergères, window dresser for the Lafayette Galleries, fashion desingner for dressmaking firms in Paris 
At the end of the 1930`s, painting that he had continued doing, led him to a new world: tapestry work. The second world war interrupted his activity. A volunteer in french army, he was taken prisoner and he was free in 1944. After his return, he set up a workshop for handcrafted furniture in Paris. He used materials such as metal, rattan, glass, Formica, and perforated sheet metal in particular, to design chairs, armchairs, tables, serving tables, sideboards, desks and useful articles. 
His activity as designer spanned a relativity short period, up to the beginning of the 1960`s. During this period, he created the three-legged chair ""nagasaki"" (1954) and the ""copacabana"" armchair (1955/1956) that are today part of the design collection at the Museum of Decoratives Arts in Paris and the design collection at the Georges Pompidou Centre, National Museum of Modern Art, Industrial centre, Beaubourg, Paris. These two pieces made in steel tube and perforated sheet metal, materials that were first used by Mathieu Matégot, are particulary representative of his work. During this decade, he also designed several decoration sites at Paris and overseas: Hotel de France at Conakry, Drugstrore Publicis, Paris, Maison de l`ORTF, Paris 1962. The Matégot`s stand is present at all great events like ""Salon des Artistes Décorateurs, SAD, Paris, or ""Salon des Arts Ménagers"", Paris. He was with Prouvé, Perriand, Royère, Adnet and the ceramist Georges Jouve in development of various projects, one of the most renowned french designer of this time. 
In early 60`s, he deliberately stopped this activity to devote himself to tapestry work. His first cartoons were woven in Aubusson, France, in 1945. He worked with Jean Lurçat, Marcel Grommaire, Mario Prassinos and many others to modernize contemporary french tapestry. Many of his exhibitions got him recognition all over the world and particulary in Paris at La Demeure gallery. His tapestries can be seen in several places: at the Woolmark Head Office at London, the Bank of International Settlements at Basel, International Monetary Fund at Washington, National Library of Australia at Camberra, Rouen préfecture, France ... 
Mathieu Matégot died in february 2001 at Angers, France.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mathieu Mategot Umbrella Stand","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","21"" high, 11.5"" diameter","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","very good original condition with some wear to white ring"

"(1) 4"" Cube Erika Lagerbielke Orrefors Crystal Artwork","MR9564","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Orrefors 
The Swedish glass industry was born about 250 years ago, not far from Orrefors - only about 20 kilometers as the crow flies. In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. 
Handblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at ""the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas"". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means ""the Orre waterfall"". 
In the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Erika Lagerbielke

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs.

Since 1860 
In post-war 1950 Antoine’s grandson, Jean, quickly shifted the focus of the company- which now employed 50 people-to contract furniture. Tables, chairs and beds were produced for commercial usage and were utilized in a variety of institutions, including schools, universities, hospitals and retirement homes. Intense growth soon followed and, 10 years later, Jean Roset entered the domestic market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Pascal Mourgue","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of Four SALA Dining Chairs

"(1) George Nelson Bubble Lamp Sconce Modernica","MR9150","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Modernica","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Bubble Lamp Sconce 
Design George Nelson, 1947 
Steel skeleton, self-webbing soft plastic. Made in USA by Modernica 

It was in 1947 that George Nelson became inspired by a self webbing material used to moth-ball ships in New York and he convinced himself it would be perfect for lighting. He made a metal frame, tracked down the source of the webbing material and by the next day he created a big glowing sphere and the Bubble Lamp was born. 

Modernica has faithfully reproduced the bubble lamps to the exact specifications using the original Howard Miller factory tooling. 
Six feet of white lamp cord included. 
The lights raise and lower.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","White Bertoia Diamond Chairs Knoll International
