His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

Plia chairs have been exhibited in design exhibitions across the globe and it is also an exponent in the design department in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. \nThe designer, who was born in Bologna in 1940, studied at the Instituto Statale d` Arte in his hometown. He later worked as an interior designer for Anonima Castelli and designed home furniture series, office furnishing systems and the legendary award-winning Plia chair. During his twelve with Castelli, he developed countless innovated furniture designs primarily in the field of chairs. \nFrom the late 1970s, he worked together with Emilio Ambasz on award-winning designs including two series of ergonomic seating systems, Vertebra und Dorsal. \nHe introduced his Piretti Collection in 1988 at the NeoCon in Chicago, a series with over 50 different office chairs and seating ensembles. The special thing about them: the furniture has a patented mechanism on the backrest that allows the chairs to be adjusted to the weight of the user. This collection also won many prizes including the IBD (USA, 1989), the ASID (USA, 1990), the Compasso d`Oro (Italy, 1991) and the G-Mark (Japan, 1992). \nThe legendary Plia chair belongs to the Castelli brand, a design institution that has been a member of the Haworth Group since 1992.",

At the time, American architects and manufacturers were adapting a wide variety of new materials, technologies, and designs to the new postwar attitudes. No more separate dining rooms that relegated kitchens to workshops for food preparation. No more formal parties that required engraved invitations, fine linen, good china, and real silver. Americans wanted to gather for fun—for barbecues, fondue parties, and smorgasbords. The walls between cooking and dining were fading away – with more casual social interactions taking center stage. \nIn 1953, the Nierenbergs were traveling in Europe in search of something that would address these burgeoning desires. In Scandinavian design they found elegant simplicity wrought from practical materials that could be furnished to the American market at reasonable prices. Through the early work of Danish designer Jens Quistgaard, they found beauty and intelligence that was both relevant and revered. Dansk was born.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

In 1965, this family-run business became a joint-stock company thus giving birth to de Sede AG. The sophisticated designs of its leather furniture, all reflecting top-quality Swiss workmanship, swiftly gained the brand an international reputation. Additional manufacturing facilities were opened and the international distribution network developed still further. \nThe rapidly expanding company called for new corporate structures. With its sale in 1984 to the concrete manufacturing company of PCW, the company’s orientation was corrected and a new management put in place. Information technology and controlling were expanded and from 1988 production was again concentrated in one location in Klingnau. New, unmistakeable products were created. \nIn 1993, de Sede changed hands in a management buy-out by Hans-Peter Fässler and Bernhard Schüler. Six years later, came the acquisition of the German upholstered furniture manufacturer Hans Kaufeld in Bielefeld, while 2000 saw the takeover of a second German company, the seating manufacturer Frank Sitzmöbel. \nThe de Sede product range is constantly being extended with work by renowned designers and the collection is nowadays hallmarked by the concept of multifunctional seating. Every year, de Sede presents its new models at the international furniture shows in Cologne and Milan.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.\nBest known for his interiors, Mr. Bennetts projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.\nBrickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. \nIn the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage. \nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles.

Archizoom was polemical in speech and practice in a period of social radicalism . Numerous projects and essays reflected \nthe group’s search for a new approach to urban design and product design. \nHe worked with this florentine studio until it closed in 1972. Since then he worked independently in Milan. He developed industrial design projects, mainly furniture, for italian companies such as Cassina, Driade, Zanotta… Deganello has taken part in international exhibitions, including: ‘radical architecture’ (1967), ‘design by circumstances, episodes in italian architecture 1962 - 1980,’ in New York; ‘the triennale`s homes’ at the Milan Triennale (1984); ‘Nouvelles Tendances’ at Paris`s Centre Pompidou (1987); and ‘Documenta 9’ in Kassel, Germany (1987). A one-man show was staged at Amsterdam`s galerie (1988), at the Japan Design Committee in Tokyo (1991)and at CAC in Cantu (2002) from 1991 he teaches industrial design at Isia in Florence.",

He distinguishes himself by his own language, which made the search for Brazilian identity one of its aims. \nHe founded, in 1955, the `Oca Industry`. The name defines an intention: to recapture the spirit of simplicity of the indigenous house, to integrate past and present in Brazilian material culture. `Oca` was created as a studio of interior design, decoration, set design and decorative components combined with an art gallery and an exhibition of furniture designed by him. He left the company in 1968, and since then has been working in his practice developing furniture lines for industrial production; architecture and interior decoration projects for hotels, residences and offices; and prefabricated housing systems. \nRodrigues has undertaken an infinity of special furniture projects, amongst others for the Brazilian Embassy in Rome, the University of Brasilia, the Arches Palace, the National Theatre in Brasilia and the headquarters of Bloch Publishers. Amongst other exhibitions, he participated in the show Convegno Brasile 93, La Construzione de una Identita Culturale, in Brescia, Italy, together with Lucio Costa and Zanine Caldas; in the Architecture Biennial in Sao Paulo; and in `Tradico e Ruptura` (tradition and rupture). He was given the Lapiz de Plata Award at the Architecture Biennial in Buenos Aires for his work as a group collection.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

        "field-2-value": "Harvey Probber \n1922-2003 \nInnovative designer and successful entrepreneur, Brooklyn-born Harvey Probber transformed the look of American furniture at mid-century. Known for his sleek modern lines and flexible modular units, Probber left an indelible stamp on the living rooms and dens of American families. The furniture he designed and produced for 40 years at his factory, Harvey Probber, Inc., first in New York and later in Fall River, Massachusetts, was elegant, up-to-date and beautifully adapted to the mobile, casual TV lifestyles that emerged in the U.S. during the post-World War II decades. \nSince Probber’s death in March of 2003, a re-evaluation of his design work and his influence on 20 th_ century style has begun. \nA self-taught modernist, Probber had virtually no artistic training when, at the age of 16, he designed his first piece—a sofa. “The key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry,” was how he characterized the source of his early inspirations. And it was those bits and pieces that led him to create the upholstered modular seating units that became a furniture industry phenomenon in the 1940s. Probber’s output, however, included much more, including the elegant sling-back chair displayed by MoMA as well as numerous tables and storage units. Later in his career, Probber turned his attention to office furniture, where his influence was as pervasive as it was in home design. Probber modified the severely functional modernist look by his use of fine fabrics, laminated surfaces and tribal-influenced woven materials. “Functional is not nearly enough,” was Probber’s credo. \nA creative force in modern design, Probber also knew what would sell and never forgot the needs of his customers. A popularizer as well as an innovator, he never strayed too far into the realm of the theoretical, one reason his work did not always receive the acclaim it deserved.",

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

Clients include Artemide, Allessi and IBM. He designed the Lambda chair in conjunction with Marro Zanusso. His main interest has always been the design of technically complex objects, from ships, chairs, watches, radios, cars, bicycles, coffeepots and toothbrushes, with fifteen of his products on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. \nAfter completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of \"young master\".",

        "field-2-value": "Charles and Ray Eames \nCharles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. \nPlatner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

The end product was not only more beautiful but much more durable, as well. \nIn America, Mr. Lloyd`s product became quite famous. His company was merged with Heywood-Wakefield, who went out of business in the 1980s.\nThe British Invasion\nIn Europe, the manufacturer in London purchased the rights and specialized equipment from Lloyd Manufacturing in 1921 and became hugely successful. But having been bombed in WWII, and the necessary materials for production unavailable due to the War effort, the company never recovered and discontinued operations in 1960. \nOver the years, Lloyd Loom British Woven Fibre Furniture has been seen on ocean liners, in hotels and tearooms; it became standard issue for the British Army and RAF all over the world; it even graced the Royal Boxes at Wimbledon, Henley and Twickenham and is often seen \"keeping the British end up\" at Royal functions.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

In another first, G-Plan was designed to be mixed and matched, and - another novelty in the post-World War II era - was also modern and affordable. As Scandinavian designs gained popularity, a Danish-designed range was added in the early-1960s. The success of G-Plan lead to E Gomme becoming one of the UK`s largest furniture manufacturers.

This region is known for having very luxurious wool that produces excellent carpets. The center of the BAKHTIARI weaving area is now southeast of Isfahan in Shahr-Kurd, and rugs of lesser quality are known by their place of manufacture, such as Bibibaff, Saman, and Luri. \nThere are nearly 200 villages in this area today, which produce some of the most charming carpets available on the market.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina.\nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

For more than two decades, she has designed glass for Orrefors that wins praise from critics and collectors alike. Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards. Her work is in the permanent collections of the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Rohasska Museum of Applied Arts and other collections worldwide.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.\nBest known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.\n\nBrickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

Rosen, a founder of Pace Furniture, purchased the company. He brought his unique experience in design and furniture manufacturing to creating a new generation of Cumberland furnishings. Rosen supplemented existing pieces with contemporary designs from European designers. \nScott F. Gilmore of S. F. Gilmore, Inc., in Grand Rapids, Michigan, purchased Cumberland in 1998. After a period of reorganization, Gilmore has brought Cumberland into a new era that expands Cumberland’s strengths and reputation while keeping its heritage in clear view. \nBetween 1998 and 2002, Scott and his staff brought the Cumberland product line in-house and worked to restore the heritage of the Cumberland name by modifying and reproducing the company’s old designs. In 2003, Cumberland Furniture partnered with Gary Lee Partners, a respected Chicago-based design firm, to restore the sophistication of the Cumberland product line.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

His first houses were built in 1948 for a cooperative in Ramapo, NY.

His work encompasses a variety of art forms, including paper mâché, ceramics and bronze. Recent innovations include distinctive lines of fine jewelry and beautifully crafted furniture, but he is primarily known for his sculpture. \nThough born in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, of both Chinese and Indian ancestry, Sergio Bustamante has lived in the Guadalajara area since early childhood. In his youth, he studied architecture at the University of Guadalajara, but abandoned this pursuit when his talents and interests drew him to the fine arts and crafts of his native land. \nBustamante`s creations reflect a uniquely imaginative individuality, style and creativity distinct from - though often copied by - other artists, making his works much desired by art aficionados worldwide. \nHe began with paintings and paper mâché figures, inaugurating the first exhibit of his works at the Galeria Misracha in Mexico City in 1966. In the early 1970`s, he traveled to Amsterdam, where he further developed his talents. After his return to Guadalajara in 1975, he established, along with other artists, the \"Family Workshop Studio\" in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, Mexico. \nBustamante`s work is a marriage of the colors and forms of his native Mexico, with an inspiration and imagination that are entirely his own. His artistic sensibility successfully combines familiar and popular imagery with the surreal. Bustamante is an artisan - and in true artisan style, he has mastered his various mediums, as well as his chosen subject matter. \nAbove all, he is known for being the author of his own universe of forms and figures. He has excelled as a painter , molder and designer, without renouncing his essential thematic obsessions. With differing aesthetic intentions, he has created a uniquely wonderful iconography that is profoundly significant, beautiful, and affecting. He continues to explore uncharted paths in the New Millennium, and is considered one of the greatest Mexican artists of our time.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. \nIn 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. \nThe world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. \nThe “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. \nDuring World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. \nMany of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.",

Repeated for countless sheets of unmarked A4-sized copier paper, the ritual itself becomes the first step of each design. \nThe ritual is characteristic of Hollington`s attention to details. He thinks about how the handle will feel when a person opens a drawer on a Relay desk. He knows what he wants a person to experience when they use any of the Relay line of products available from Herman Miller for the Home. Geoff encourages a sense of surprise and discovery in those who see and use his products. He expects a person slipping for the first time into the Hollington executive chair, also available from Herman Miller for the Home, to say, `Yes, of course, this is how a chair should feel.` \nHollington studied design at the Royal College of Art in London in the early 1970s and shortly afterward `discovered` Herman Miller and the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames. `If you asked me, way back, what`s the one company in the world I`d really like to work for, it would have been Herman Miller,` he says. \nHis hands come up to carve a rectangle out of the air as he describes the designer`s challenge of creating a humane environment for work. `In the 1960s and 1970s, we tended to think of offices as factories or laboratories. We`re moving into a time when we think of offices as places where we can be creative.` \nIt is this approach to design that makes his designs as appropriate for the home as for the office. \nHollington`s desk is littered with used Edding 55 pens that no longer draw fine lines. He readily tosses copier paper into the bin. The paper, in fact, has commodity status, he says. No brand is perfect. Ideas are tried and rejected. It is the ritual.",

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

The center of the BAKHTIARI weaving area is now southeast of Isfahan in Shahr-Kurd, and rugs of lesser quality are known by their place of manufacture, such as Bibibaff, Saman, and Luri. \nThere are nearly 200 villages in this area today, which produce some of the most charming carpets available on the market.",

Examples of carpet types are the Lavar Kerman carpet from Kerman and the Seraband rug from Arak. \nAn important innovation in weaving that was developed in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age was the introduction of foot pedals to operate a loom. The first such devices appeared in Syria, Iran and Islamic parts of East Africa, where \"the operator sat with his feet in a pit below a fairly low-slung loom.\" By 1177, it was further developed in Al-Andalus, where having the mechanism was \"raised higher above the ground on a more substantial frame.\" This type of loom spread to the Christian parts of Spain and soon became popular all over medieval Europe.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Baughman’s family moved to Long Beach, California in the mid 1920s. \nA highly creative child, he was given carte blanche at age 13 to design the new family home. Baughman served in the Air Force during World War II, and also designed officer`s clubs. After the war, he studied architecture and product design at the Art Center School of Los Angeles, and the California School of the Arts. \nHis training complete, Baughman took a job with the Frank Brothers department store, an emporium noted for its design focus. He worked as a salesman and a window dresser; on the side, he became involved with the influential publication Furniture Forum. His growing reputation soon attracted furniture manufacturer Glenn of California, which hired Baughman to design a new collection. Working mainly with walnut, formica and wrought iron, Baughman created simple, understated pieces; many were conceived as space dividers, functioning admirably in the open plan interiors characteristic of the California Modern style. \nAfter briefly running his own workshop, Baughman began a long and fruitful association in 1953 with Thayer Coggin, a North Carolina furniture company. His accessibly stylish furniture proved very popular with middle class consumers, and he quickly became a household name. He has designed hundreds of pieces for Thayer Coggin to date; among the noteworthy are the 820-400 chaise (1954), the leather and chrome 951-103 arm chair (1962), and the Shelter sofa (1967). \nBaughman`s work was included in the Whitney Museum`s 1985 exhibit \"High Styles: Twentieth Century American Design\". In recognition of his monumental impact on American taste, Baughman was inducted into the Furniture Designers Hall of Fame in 1987. Today, he directs the Environmental Design Department at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

He has lived in many European cities – Padua, Venice, London, Helsinki, Paris – and since 1980, in New York. His multidisciplinary work is present in the permanent collections of Museums in France, Finland, the United States, England, Portugal and Italy. Gaetano Pesce has been teaching for twenty-six years at the École d’Architecture de Strasbourg and has lectured in the most prominent Universities and Cultural Institutions around the world. He has worked in France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United States, Brazil and Belgium. Pesce’s works are often memorable for their ability to give an unexpected twist to favorite themes: the “diversified series”, the twin functionality of objects and architecture, the creative use of colour, the political dimension of the project, the theory and practice of the “poorly executed”, the use and development of synthetic materials, the theory of the “femininity” of architectural projects and the “culture of objects”.",

The creativity of the crafts person, the unpredictability of the fluids, and the opportunity to insert variables â€“ from choice of color to distribution of materials are some of the paths to obtaining the diversity and uniqueness of a fish design object. The choice of materials is an essential element and the use of fluid, dynamic, variable, & expressive resins was not a casual choice. Plastic materials represent the idea of the future for Gaetano Pesce and have offered him the opportunity to innovate and search for a new concept of beauty. \n\nPart of the historical collection 1995, the try trays are cast in solid resin. Bears the fish design logo and year of production. \nNote: because of fish design’s manufacturing process each piece is an original, bubbles, imperfections, and dimension variations also vary widely.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent.

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, \"Organic Design in Home Furnishings.\" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \n\nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

In another first, G-Plan was designed to be mixed and matched, and - another novelty in the post-World War II era - was also modern and affordable. As Scandinavian designs gained popularity, a Danish-designed range was added in the early-1960s. The success of G-Plan lead to E Gomme becoming one of the UK`s largest furniture manufacturers.

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

By the mid-thirties sales had increased to such a level that two large mills were installed to make the steel tubing on site. \n1950 After the war, company returned to manufacturing regular line of products, greatly expanding our furniture operations. New lines were introduced including booths and tables for restaurants, dinette sets for homes and chair settees for offices. \n1970 Furniture business was sold to Gleason Corporation of Milwaukee.",

        "field-2-value": "Gilbert Rohde \n(American, 1894-1944) \nDesigner Gilbert Rohde was born and raised in New York, the son of a cabinetmaker. He left high school to pursue a variety of jobs, landing a short stint at a local paper, the Bronx News, drawing political cartoons. In 1923 he turned the experience into a job as an illustrator at the Abraham & Strauss department store. Inspired by a trip to the Paris Exhibition in 1925, Rohde began designing furniture and his early work was sold at Lord & Taylor. An exuberant modernist, his pieces gleaned simplicity and rationalism from Bauhaus design and a sense of form and ornamentation from Art Deco. He worked predominantly in Bakelite and chrome, the materials that made up the visual vocabulary of the period. \nBetween 1927-28 Rohde designed the interiors for Avedon fashion stores, where his wife was part of the advertising team. Heywood-Wakefield of Massachusetts began picking up his designs in 1930, with a bentwood chair being one of their most successful pieces. Restless for a more substantial opportunity, he went west to Grand Rapids, Michigan where companies like John Widdicomb and Herman Miller had turned the city into a hub of furniture design and manufacturing. Rohde attracted the interest of Herman Miller and began designing for them in 1931. The company had been making traditional pieces and historical reproductions and was close to bankruptcy when they accepted Rohde`s modern work in a last ditch attempt to stay afloat. Apparently the miracle they needed, Rohde convinced them that modernism was the reigning style and proved it with his designs for bedroom furniture shown at the 1933 Chicago World`s Fair. Fortified by their updated image, Herman Miller had Rohde design entire sets for living and dining rooms and began making plans to halt their production of traditional pieces. Rohde designed a popular line of modular office furniture for Herman Miller, and they would later reintroduce the bentwood chair he made for Heywood-Wakefield. He also acted as the Design Director for several years. \nDuring his tenure with Herman Miller Rohde was also pursuing a number of outside projects. He made a line of chrome chairs for the Troy Sunshade Company in 1933 and also worked some with Thonet. His designs were exhibited at the show of Machine Art at the MoMA in 1934 as well as at the Art and Industry show inside New York`s RCA building. In 1939 he exhibited work at the New York World`s Fair. He acted as the director of the Design Laboratory, also in New York, from 1935-38, and was the head of industrial design at the NYU School of Architecture from 1939-43.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

Sergio is undoubtedly one of the most admirable expressions of design in our country. The single trait consistent and put your name in the history of 20th century design, especially the creation of a wide variety of products, the most famous is the Armchair Mole.\nNext to masters like Jose Joaquim Tenreiro and Zanine Caldas, Sergio is making the Brazilian designer known internationally. While Tenreiro, with its mobile sober, was the forerunner in the search for a new style, Zanine wood pulled all of its expressive potential and Sergio Rodrigues has a wide experience in production, trying to think Brazil by design. He completely transformed the language of the mobile, was generous in the dash and the employment of native woods and, as well Lucio Costa said, \"with the creation of the OCA has the ambiance of the interior movement of renewal of our architecture.\" \nThe Brazilian production in this sector (furniture) in the mid-50s, was still prey to the very styles, and its renewal require two battles. Sergio knew that the only weapon that it was the design and that there was gone. \nInitially, as architect, worked alongside David Dobson, Flavio Regis do Nascimento and Olaf Redig Field project in the Civic Center in Curitiba, significant work in the context of modern Brazilian architecture. But, knowing their interests vigorously and trails for a path for other great architects like John Vilanova Artigas, Oscar Niemeyer, Oswaldo Bratke and Paulo Mendes da Rocha, Sergio jumped from architecture to the design of the mobile. \nMoreover, he was absolutely convinced that the \"architecture in the planning of internal space was not adequately studied architecture was not, it was sculpture.\" \nFor Lucio Costa, in some parts Sergio Rodrigues succeeded redeem the spirit of traditional furniture and also aspects of indigenous Australia. \"In fact, at that time he did the Brazil-Brazilian co-exist with Brazil-de-Ipanema, sung later (1962) by Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Morais in the famous\" Girl from Ipanema, \"and with Brazil`s Sao Paulo industrialization, Oca was actually the representative of selected models of the main factories of Sao Paulo. \" That is why the name Oca: a return to indigenous sources, the taste for traditional materials. Sergio immediately launched a search for permanent projects, methods and materials to meet adequately the needs of the user, unrelated to fashions and styles. According to Oscar Niemeyer: \"At that time (beginning of Brasilia) have not had time to think about designing mobile no. We use current mobile market, selecting the Palace as required. The main furniture designer who was asked Sergio Rodriguez.\" At activities in the sector of furniture is fundamental to highlight the work of Sergio in the planning of interiors, the ambience, the scenery and decoration. Within the interior, cooperating with the most important architects Brazilians, and in his own store - The Oca - provided various consultancy in the country and abroad legitimizing the \"interior design\" in Brazil. \n\"The accuracy of the mobile modern design with certain objects of Brazilian culture, and not concerned about fashions, accentuating the spirit of Brazilian Sergio Rodrigues that both search. These two facts were clear from the jury`s decision of the Fourth Biennial of Mobile, Cantu, Italy 1961, winning with the Sheriff Armchair between 400 candidates from 35 countries. \"",

As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage. \nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

Her lounge seating, sofas, tables, and storage adapt flawlessly to any environment, with their clean, linear design and incredibly durable, high-quality construction. These pieces are built to last a lifetime - or several lifetimes. Not flashy pieces at all, Knoll said that her own work \"filled in the gaps\" for star pieces by Bertoia and Saarinen, but today we know that they stand in a class all by themselves.",

In the summer of 1742 the first glassworks, warehouse, potash furnace and smithy were inaugurated in which is now the small village of Kosta. \nHandblown glass has thus been produced in this part of Sweden for more than two and a half centuries. The story of Orrefors begins with Iron and the forest. As early as 1726, Lars Johan Silversparre received permission to build a furnace and a smithy at \"the beautiful river that flows into Lake Orrenas\". The iron works was given the name Orrefors, which means \"the Orre waterfall\". \nIn the early years, output comprised both simple types of glassware, such as jars, table glass, lampshades and perfume vials, and large pieces. Expertise in more complex technology was acquired by recruiting workers from other glassworks, such as Kosta, and from the Continent. A group of skilled craftsmen rapidly collected around Orrefors, and in a short time the glassworks acquired the expertise that paved the way for its future success.",

Erika has produced a body of work in sculpture, art and functional glass collections that connect the enduring Orrefors traditions of elegance and innovation in design with contemporary styles and tastes: rich color and bold cut detail are characteristic of her designs. Among Erika`s major artistic successes are her Intermezzo, Merlot and Difference stemware, all of which have won Excellent Swedish Design awards.

        "field-2-value": "Harvey Probber \n1922-2003 \nInnovative designer and successful entrepreneur, Brooklyn-born Harvey Probber transformed the look of American furniture at mid-century. Known for his sleek modern lines and flexible modular units, Probber left an indelible stamp on the living rooms and dens of American families. The furniture he designed and produced for 40 years at his factory, Harvey Probber, Inc., first in New York and later in Fall River, Massachusetts, was elegant, up-to-date and beautifully adapted to the mobile, casual TV lifestyles that emerged in the U.S. during the post-World War II decades. \nSince Probber’s death in March of 2003, a re-evaluation of his design work and his influence on 20 th_ century style has begun. \nA self-taught modernist, Probber had virtually no artistic training when, at the age of 16, he designed his first piece—a sofa. “The key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry,” was how he characterized the source of his early inspirations. And it was those bits and pieces that led him to create the upholstered modular seating units that became a furniture industry phenomenon in the 1940s. Probber’s output, however, included much more, including the elegant sling-back chair displayed by MoMA as well as numerous tables and storage units. Later in his career, Probber turned his attention to office furniture, where his influence was as pervasive as it was in home design. Probber modified the severely functional modernist look by his use of fine fabrics, laminated surfaces and tribal-influenced woven materials. “Functional is not nearly enough,” was Probber’s credo. \nA creative force in modern design, Probber also knew what would sell and never forgot the needs of his customers. A popularizer as well as an innovator, he never strayed too far into the realm of the theoretical, one reason his work did not always receive the acclaim it deserved.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget.

He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. \nPlatner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

He settled in France in 1931, where he took up various professions, creating sets for the Folies Bergères, window dresser for the Lafayette Galleries, fashion desingner for dressmaking firms in Paris \nAt the end of the 1930`s, painting that he had continued doing, led him to a new world: tapestry work. The second world war interrupted his activity. A volunteer in french army, he was taken prisoner and he was free in 1944. After his return, he set up a workshop for handcrafted furniture in Paris. He used materials such as metal, rattan, glass, Formica, and perforated sheet metal in particular, to design chairs, armchairs, tables, serving tables, sideboards, desks and useful articles. \nHis activity as designer spanned a relativity short period, up to the beginning of the 1960`s. During this period, he created the three-legged chair \"nagasaki\" (1954) and the \"copacabana\" armchair (1955/1956) that are today part of the design collection at the Museum of Decoratives Arts in Paris and the design collection at the Georges Pompidou Centre, National Museum of Modern Art, Industrial centre, Beaubourg, Paris. These two pieces made in steel tube and perforated sheet metal, materials that were first used by Mathieu Matégot, are particulary representative of his work. During this decade, he also designed several decoration sites at Paris and overseas: Hotel de France at Conakry, Drugstrore Publicis, Paris, Maison de l`ORTF, Paris 1962. The Matégot`s stand is present at all great events like \"Salon des Artistes Décorateurs, SAD, Paris, or \"Salon des Arts Ménagers\", Paris. He was with Prouvé, Perriand, Royère, Adnet and the ceramist Georges Jouve in development of various projects, one of the most renowned french designer of this time. \nIn early 60`s, he deliberately stopped this activity to devote himself to tapestry work. His first cartoons were woven in Aubusson, France, in 1945. He worked with Jean Lurçat, Marcel Grommaire, Mario Prassinos and many others to modernize contemporary french tapestry. Many of his exhibitions got him recognition all over the world and particulary in Paris at La Demeure gallery. His tapestries can be seen in several places: at the Woolmark Head Office at London, the Bank of International Settlements at Basel, International Monetary Fund at Washington, National Library of Australia at Camberra, Rouen préfecture, France ... \nMathieu Matégot died in february 2001 at Angers, France.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",
