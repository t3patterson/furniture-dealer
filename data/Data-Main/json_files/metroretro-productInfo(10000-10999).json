In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. \nRohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” \nhe said. \nA deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. \n“You’re providing a way of life.” \nDisdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time. \nAnd with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune. \nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944. \nBest known for his interiors, Mr. Bennetts projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. \nBrickel Associates became Geiger Brickel.

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.\nBest known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.\nBrickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.",

After completing his degree, he joined the family business, Atelier Varedo (later Arredamento Borsani) as a furniture designer. Throughout the 1940s and early 50s, Osvaldo produced a large body of work including case goods, storage pieces and seating. Especially noteworthy was a 1946 wall-mounted shelving system. Among his clients were Crippa, Fabbri, Fontana and Sussu. \nIn 1953, Osvaldo and Fulgencio founded a firm called Tecno, which, as its name suggests, became known for it’s technology- and research-based, approach to furniture design. In 1955, Tenco issued one of its best-known pieces, the P40 chaise longue. Described as a \"machine for sitting\", it featured rubber arms and could assume 486 distinct postures; the D70, a sofa version, was also manufactured. \nOsvaldo himself acted as the company`s sole designer for over 30 years; it was not until the mid 1980s that Gae Aulenti, Norman Foster and others began to contribute designs. Today, Tecno is known for its innovative furniture for offices and public buildings. \nOsvaldo had a long history of participation in the Triennale di Milano dating back to 1933, when he collaborated with architects Cairoli and G. B. Varisco on a project called the \"Casa Minima\"; he would continue to exhibit his work there for decades to come. Museums and galleries throughout Europe and, in 1962 showcased his designs; he received the prestigious Premio Compasso d’Oro.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. \nRohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” \nhe said. \nA deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. \n“You’re providing a way of life.” \nDisdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.\nAnd with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.",

During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. \nIn 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. \nThe world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. \nThe “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. \nDuring World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. \nMany of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, \"Organic Design in Home Furnishings.\" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates. A number of Saarinen`s chairs for Knoll were to become landmarks in the history of 20th century design.",

After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

She graduated from the Kingswood School before studying at the famous Cranbrook Academy of Art (both institutions are located on the same campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan). Knoll also received a bachelor`s degree in architecture from Armour Institute (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1941 and briefly worked with leaders of the Bauhaus movement, including Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Wallace K. Harrison. \n\nIn 1938, Hans Knoll founded his furniture company by that name in New York. In 1943, Florence Schust convinced Hans she could help bring in business to his company even in America`s wartime economy by expanding into interior design by working with architects. With her architectural background and design flair, she succeeded. They married in 1946, she became a full business partner and together they founded Knoll Associates. A new furniture factory was established in Pennsylvania and dealers in Knoll`s furniture were carefully added over the next several years.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

By means of progressive lightening of the structure (a triangular section of just 18 millimeters at the side) and modification of the shape of the struts, a particularly strong chair weighing only 1,66 kilos was achieved. Produced and sold for almost fifty years, the Superleggera is a symbol of the dialectical force between the poetics of the designer and the persistence and technological know-how of the Cassina craftsmen.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

A mid-century architect, Weese built primarily in the modern architectural style, but integrated other styles as he felt appropriate for the project. Because Weese believed that design was essentially problem-solving, he was willing to apply his skills to everything from a piece of furniture to an entire city. Weese is well known for his firm advocacy of historic preservation and was remembered as the architect who \"shaped Chicago’s skyline and the way the city thought about everything from the lakefront to its treasure-trove of historical buildings\". \nWeese produced a large number of significant designs ranging from small but highly inventive houses to large urban scale commissions like the Washington, D.C., Metro system. Although influenced to some degree by the rational, and often austere, work of European modernists like Mies van der Rohe, in most of his own bodies of work Weese instead followed the example of Nordic architects like Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto in favoring natural materials, human scale, and comfort; his work was characterized by a deep respect for older buildings and existing urban patterns and a fondness for unexpected, often idiosyncratic design decisions.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. \nIn 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. \nThe world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. \nThe “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. \nDuring World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. \nMany of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.",

A graduate of the Royal School of Architecture in Rome, Girard refined his skills in both Florence and New York. \n\nGirard is widely known for his contributions in the field of American textile design, particularly through his work for Herman Miller (1952 to 1975), where he created fabrics for the designs of George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames. \n\nHis work also includes designing the La Fonda del Sol Restaurant in New York (1960), the Herman Miller Showplace: T&O (Textiles and Objects) (1961), Braniff Airlines (1965). and the Girard Foundation (1962), which houses his extensive folk art collection.

Because Weese believed that design was essentially problem-solving, he was willing to apply his skills to everything from a piece of furniture to an entire city. Weese is well known for his firm advocacy of historic preservation and was remembered as the architect who \"shaped Chicago’s skyline and the way the city thought about everything from the lakefront to its treasure-trove of historical buildings\". \nWeese produced a large number of significant designs ranging from small but highly inventive houses to large urban scale commissions like the Washington, D.C., Metro system. Although influenced to some degree by the rational, and often austere, work of European modernists like Mies van der Rohe, in most of his own bodies of work Weese instead followed the example of Nordic architects like Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto in favoring natural materials, human scale, and comfort; his work was characterized by a deep respect for older buildings and existing urban patterns and a fondness for unexpected, often idiosyncratic design decisions.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. \nIn 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. \nThe world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. \nThe “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. \nDuring World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. \nMany of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.",

J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. \nRohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” \nhe said. \nA deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. \n“You’re providing a way of life.” \nDisdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.\nAnd with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. \nAfter completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office.

J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. \nRohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” \nhe said. \nA deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. \n“You’re providing a way of life.” \nDisdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.\nAnd with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, \"Organic Design in Home Furnishings.\" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates. A number of Saarinen`s chairs for Knoll were to become landmarks in the history of 20th century design.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \"He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,\" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. \nOne of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called \"opulent simplicity\" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.\nSince then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchares whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.",

Small wooden furniture pieces such as occasional accent tables, plant stands and butlers’ tables were advertised in magazines and shipped to customers in boxes ready to be assembled, usually by just screwing on the legs. \nIn February of 2008 the business was bought by a privately held, family owned company, renamed Bombay & Co., Inc. and is now 100% Canadian owned and operated.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

From 1939 to 1943, he set up a metal workshop and began to teach jewelry and metal working. In 1943, he worked with Charles and Ray Eames for the Evans Product Company where they experimented on molded-plywood seating.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

In another first, G-Plan was designed to be mixed and matched, and - another novelty in the post-World War II era - was also modern and affordable. As Scandinavian designs gained popularity, a Danish-designed range was added in the early-1960s. The success of G-Plan lead to E Gomme becoming one of the UK`s largest furniture manufacturers. The company, now based at modern offices near Melksham, Wiltshire, presently operates under the name of G-Plan Upholstry Ltd.",

Known for his sleek modern lines and flexible modular units, Probber left an indelible stamp on the living rooms and dens of American families. The furniture he designed and produced for 40 years at his factory, Harvey Probber, Inc., first in New York and later in Fall River, Massachusetts, was elegant, up-to-date and beautifully adapted to the mobile, casual TV lifestyles that emerged in the U.S. during the post-World War II decades. \nSince Probber’s death in March of 2003, a re-evaluation of his design work and his influence on 20 th_ century style has begun. \nA self-taught modernist, Probber had virtually no artistic training when, at the age of 16, he designed his first piece—a sofa. “The key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry,” was how he characterized the source of his early inspirations. And it was those bits and pieces that led him to create the upholstered modular seating units that became a furniture industry phenomenon in the 1940s. Probber’s output, however, included much more, including the elegant sling-back chair displayed by MoMA as well as numerous tables and storage units. Later in his career, Probber turned his attention to office furniture, where his influence was as pervasive as it was in home design. Probber modified the severely functional modernist look by his use of fine fabrics, laminated surfaces and tribal-influenced woven materials. “Functional is not nearly enough,” was Probber’s credo. \nA creative force in modern design, Probber also knew what would sell and never forgot the needs of his customers. A popularizer as well as an innovator, he never strayed too far into the realm of the theoretical, one reason his work did not always receive the acclaim it deserved.",

Umunoff tried in his work to substantiate the thesis that the fundamentals of good design are in every way analogous to good homemaking. Accordingly, he works each item of furniture from the drawing board, through his own shop where he handled the raw materials directly, to actual use in his New York home with wife, Charlotte, and two young sons. As a partner in Post Modern, Ltd., which manufactured from his designs. Arthur had a hand in producing, merchandising, and selling, too. \n\nSome of his most interesting pieces are those which combine wrought iron and wood or laminated plastic: well sized desk (36x24x45), in birch, walnut or Formica; combination lamp table and magazine rack in the same materials. \n\nHis most recognizable early work designs were for Shaver Howard. \n\nUmanoff`s work for Elton continues with the introduction of chairs, serving carts and a complete line of case pieces which get Elton and Umanoff chosen for the 1953 Good Design Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. \n\nThe Umanoff designs for Elton (1953) were also featured for the 1954 Storage: Volume 4 of the Interiors Library series edited by George Nelson.",

He afterwards worked briefly as a naval architect, designing ocean liner interiors, and then as art director for a motion picture studio. In 1926, he became a salesman for an antiques dealer who specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture, and Robsjohn-Gibbings was assigned prominent accounts such as Elizabeth Arden and Neiman Marcus. \nIn the late 1930s and 1940s he was the most important decorator in America. After opening a shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936, Robsjohn-Gibbings proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such scions as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf, and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \nThe design work of T. H. Robsjohn Gibbings is hallmarked as a modern mixture of the classical elements of Ancient Grecian design, and Art Deco design. It features mosaic floor reproductions, sculptural fragments, and sparse furnishings, all combining to achieve his trademark brand of modern historicism. \nT. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings much preferred the visual vocabulary of the classical world, particularly ancient Greek furniture and design. Robsjohn-Gibbings` look was widely emulated, and, from 1943-56, he worked as a designer for the Widdicomb furniture company in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \nIn 1960, he met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, which drew heavily on classical forms. It is still in production. Robsjohn-Gibbings eventually moved to Athens, where he became designer to Aristotle Onassis. \nHis honors include the 1950 Waters Award and the 1962 Elsie de Wolfe Award.",

His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \"He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,\" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. \nOne of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called \"opulent simplicity\" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.\nSince then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art DÃ©co style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. \nAfter completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office.

He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. \nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960 they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their Bastiano set couch, lounge chair, tables were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the Coronado series of armchairs and the Soriana chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

His uniquely American designs were forward-thinking and distinctive, yet unpretentious and affordable. His prolific and highly influential work continues to be copied, reinvented and revived in the new and secondary decorative arts markets by contemporary furniture designers and dealers alike. Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies starting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch Gordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and Drexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.",

He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. \nPlatner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. \nRohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” \nhe said. \nA deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. \n“You’re providing a way of life.” \nDisdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time. \nAnd with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\n\nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

After World War II, Wormley set up a private practice in interior and furniture design with Dunbar as his primary client. He used wood and upholstery in a tailored way that seemed comfortable to an audience not totally ready for the austerity of International Style design. Wormley often called his designs \"transitional\", and he did no hesitate to use forms as those of the ancient Greek Klismos chair. His Dunbar furniture was included in a number of \"Good Design\" exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.",

Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers \"a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,\" and encouraging \"stimulating a healthy diversity.\" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

This unique combination of sophisticated European avant-garde modern design and American technical know-how allowed Rowland to create some of the most unique and comfortable seating produced. \n\nAfter opening his own office in 1954, David Rowland pursued numerous experiments in minimal seating with the goal of accomodating large numbers of people. These exercises culminated with the much lauded 40/4 Chair, designed in 1963 and was immediately awarded the grand prize at the prestigous Milan Triennale the next year. \n\nDavid Rowland went on to design numerous other chairs that satisfy the rigorous demands of mass production while retaining a high level of design sophistication, but the 40/4 chair has never been surpassed, by Rowland or others.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R.

J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. \nRohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” \nhe said. \nA deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. \n“You’re providing a way of life.” \nDisdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.\nAnd with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.",

He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

These fluid, sculptural shapes influenced the future work of both men; for Saarinen, most notably in his Womb, Tulip and Executive chairs. The Executive was originally made of fiberglass but was later updated in polyurethane. The molded shell flexes slightly with the sitter and the contoured plywood seat supported by metal or wood legs. Unlike Saarinen`s furniture, which was consistently sculptural in form, these fluid lines didn`t appear in his architecture until the 1950s.
