Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Early Eames For Herman Miller Lounge Chair And Ottoman
The Eames Lounge Chair is one of the most widely recognized and imitated furniture designs ever created! Eames wanted to build a simple and practical lounge chair with ""the warm receptive look of a well used first baseman`s mitt."" Well...he created a timeless classic. Considered one of the most significant and widely recognized furniture designs of the 20th century, the Eames lounge chair and ottoman set an enduring standard for comfort and elegance. The rich veneer and supple leather suggest old-fashioned luxury translated into modern forms. This treasured collector`s item would make a wonderful accent to any home or office.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Lounge Chair 33"" Width x 32"" Depth x 33"" Height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller George Nelson Desk with attached file drawers

American, 1894-1944 
It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. 
Then he met D. J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” 
he said. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. 
“You’re providing a way of life.” 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time. 
And with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","An Art Deco table designed by Gilbert Rohde and made by Heywood Wakefield in the 1930’s.

After joining Knoll in 1956, he led many interior design projects as Senior Designer of the Knoll Planning Unit from 1956 to 1967. During this time he coordinated Knoll work in residences, universities, executive offices and showrooms, including the Knoll showrooms in Philadelphia, Boston and Saint Louis. In addition to designing the massive CBS building project, Cafiero was a believer and outspoken proponent of the ""Knoll approach"" to business and design. From 1965 to 1969, Cafiero also designed Knoll library furniture and equipment, and in 1974, the Cafiero 5800 series desk line, among many other related products.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll International Arm Chair Designed by Vincent Cafiero High Back Version

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944. 
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennetts projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. 
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Ward Bennett Lounge Chairs on Casters

Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer

Jay Spectre`s design career began when he joined the staff of Hubbuch, a store in his hometown of Louisville, KY. In 1968, he moved to New York to form his own design firm and has since received much recognition for his work. Spectre is the only designer represented in the permanent collection of the New York State Museum. He was named one of the top eight Designers of America by the Smithsonian Institution as part of their ""Giants of Design 1979"" exhibition. The Chicago Merchandise Mart awarded him the Residential Design Excellence Award in 1982 and their Dean of Design award in 1983. 

Jay Spectre`s work has been published in Interior Design, Architectural Digest and Abitare. The Jay Spectre Collection--a sixty-piece collection of furniture utilizing glass, wood and metals--was designed for the Century Furniture Company and was unveiled as part of Bloomingdale`s centennial celebration. Projects include a print collection for American Textiles, the design of tabletop items for Sasaki and a line of lamps for George W. Hansen, Inc.

Thayer Coggin is known as one of the fine names in residential furniture manufacturing. Entering into business in 1953, Thayer Coggin carved out an identity in the home furnishings market through a commitment to modern, classic design. 
Family owned and run, Thayer Coggin has 350,000 square feet of manufacturing space to produce some of the most recognizable furniture designs in the residential market. 
Through founder Thayer Coggin`s vision, and Milo Baughman`s creations, a Distinguished Design Award honoree, Thayer Coggin has amassed a highly original collection of furniture. Now approaching its fifth decade of furniture manufacturing, Thayer Coggin is poised to maintain its position of prominence into the next century.

Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget.

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edward Wormley Stacking Unit Cube Side Tables

The world`s most singular, severely elegant collection of contemporary furniture has been created by Nicos Zographos. He has produced more than 300 kinds of products for thousands of spaces in America and Europe. Zographos is the last adherent to the strict aesthetic principles first defined by the European Bauhaus school, and he is very likely one of the last designers to manage his own manufacturing company. Within a business bounded by commercial constraints, his enduring values have significantly influenced both the style and the standards of the modern furniture industry. This piece carries the rounded corners, a recognizable Zographos element.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Nicos Zographos created this side chair in 1966 out of tubular steel and high quality black leather.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","42"" Vintage Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Dining Table

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","1950`S DUNBAR`S (9)NINE-FOOT SOFA DESIGNED BY EDWARD WORMLEY

Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","84"" Brickel Ward Bennett Tufted Sofa Couch

In 1937, Osvaldo entered the Politecnico di Milano to study architecture. After completing his degree, he joined the family business, Atelier Varedo (later Arredamento Borsani) as a furniture designer. Throughout the 1940s and early 50s, Osvaldo produced a large body of work including case goods, storage pieces and seating. Especially noteworthy was a 1946 wall-mounted shelving system. Among his clients were Crippa, Fabbri, Fontana and Sussu. 
In 1953, Osvaldo and Fulgencio founded a firm called Tecno, which, as its name suggests, became known for it’s technology- and research-based, approach to furniture design. In 1955, Tenco issued one of its best-known pieces, the P40 chaise longue. Described as a ""machine for sitting"", it featured rubber arms and could assume 486 distinct postures; the D70, a sofa version, was also manufactured. 
Osvaldo himself acted as the company`s sole designer for over 30 years; it was not until the mid 1980s that Gae Aulenti, Norman Foster and others began to contribute designs. Today, Tecno is known for its innovative furniture for offices and public buildings. 
Osvaldo had a long history of participation in the Triennale di Milano dating back to 1933, when he collaborated with architects Cairoli and G. B. Varisco on a project called the ""Casa Minima""; he would continue to exhibit his work there for decades to come. Museums and galleries throughout Europe and, in 1962 showcased his designs; he received the prestigious Premio Compasso d’Oro.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stow Davis Borsani Marble Dining Table with Bronze Base

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller two-drawer lateral filing cabinets.

American, 1894-1944 
It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. 
Then he met D. J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” 
he said. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. 
“You’re providing a way of life.” 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.
And with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","1930’s Art Deco extension dining table designed by Gilbert Rohde and made by Heywood Wakefield.

"(6) Vintage Swivel Good Form Adjustable Aluminum Arm Chairs","MR10001","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Vintage Good Form Adjustable Aluminum Arm Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.75"" Width x 20"" Depth x 31"" Height

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) One Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

An immediate classic upon its introduction in 1956 but a design in progress since his work with Charles Eames in the 1940 MOMA Organic Design contest, Saarinen`s objective was to clarify the furniture forms he designed. ""The undercarriage of chairs and tables makes an ugly, confusing, unrestful world. I wanted to clean up the slum of legs and make the chair all one thing again.""

Harry Bertoia made a foray into furniture design in the 1950s with Knoll Associates that, while brief, was so powerful and enduring that the royalties alone from his series allowed him to turn his attention to sculpture for the rest of his life. Bertoia emigrated to America in 1930. He studied at the Cass Technical High School in Detroit and trained on a scholarship at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Michigan. From 1939 to 1943, he set up a metal workshop and began to teach jewelry and metal working.

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 
Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Tobia Scarpa Chrome Andre Dining Table

Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Chairs by Milo Baughman

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Thonet Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","33"" Herman Miller George Nelson shelf unit.

Knoll believes good design is good business. A commitment to modern design has yielded a comprehensive portfolio of furniture products and textiles designed to provide enduring value and help clients shape their workspaces with imagination and vision. Recognized as a design leader worldwide, Knoll products are exhibited in major art museums, with more than 40 pieces in the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Florence Knoll 

Florence Knoll Bassett (born May 24, 1917) is an American architect and furniture designer who studied under Mies van der Rohe and Eliel Saarinen. She was born in Saginaw, Michigan as Florence Schust and is known in familiar circles simply as ""Shu"". She graduated from the Kingswood School before studying at the famous Cranbrook Academy of Art (both institutions are located on the same campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan). Knoll also received a bachelor`s degree in architecture from Armour Institute (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1941 and briefly worked with leaders of the Bauhaus movement, including Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Wallace K. Harrison. 

In 1938, Hans Knoll founded his furniture company by that name in New York. In 1943, Florence Schust convinced Hans she could help bring in business to his company even in America`s wartime economy by expanding into interior design by working with architects. With her architectural background and design flair, she succeeded. They married in 1946, she became a full business partner and together they founded Knoll Associates. A new furniture factory was established in Pennsylvania and dealers in Knoll`s furniture were carefully added over the next several years.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Florence Knoll Lounge Chairs

Gio Ponti`s Superleggera chair (1957) would not have been possible without the skill and capacity of experimentation and workmanship of Cassina and its craftsmen. By means of progressive lightening of the structure (a triangular section of just 18 millimeters at the side) and modification of the shape of the struts, a particularly strong chair weighing only 1,66 kilos was achieved. Produced and sold for almost fifty years, the Superleggera is a symbol of the dialectical force between the poetics of the designer and the persistence and technological know-how of the Cassina craftsmen.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17"" width x 17"" depth x 32"" height

A mid-century architect, Weese built primarily in the modern architectural style, but integrated other styles as he felt appropriate for the project. Because Weese believed that design was essentially problem-solving, he was willing to apply his skills to everything from a piece of furniture to an entire city. Weese is well known for his firm advocacy of historic preservation and was remembered as the architect who ""shaped Chicago’s skyline and the way the city thought about everything from the lakefront to its treasure-trove of historical buildings"". 
Weese produced a large number of significant designs ranging from small but highly inventive houses to large urban scale commissions like the Washington, D.C., Metro system. Although influenced to some degree by the rational, and often austere, work of European modernists like Mies van der Rohe, in most of his own bodies of work Weese instead followed the example of Nordic architects like Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto in favoring natural materials, human scale, and comfort; his work was characterized by a deep respect for older buildings and existing urban patterns and a fondness for unexpected, often idiosyncratic design decisions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","20.5""w x 19.5""h","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Lounge Chair

"Herman Miller George Nelson Expandable Dining Set Table and Six Chairs","MR10184","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Expandable Dining Table and Six Chairs

This was a hotel constructed between 1946 and 1949 by wildcatter Glenn McCarthy southwest of downtown Houston, Texas next to the Texas Medical Center. It was the largest hotel built in the United States during the 1940s.[1] The grand opening of the Shamrock is still cited as one of the biggest social events ever held in Houston.[2] Sold to Hilton Hotels in 1955 and operated for over three decades as the Shamrock Hilton, the facility endured financial struggles throughout its history. In 1985, Hilton Hotels donated the building to the Texas Medical Center and the structure was demolished on June 1, 1987.

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates. A number of Saarinen`s chairs for Knoll were to become landmarks in the history of 20th century design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Saarinen Knoll Tulip Base Marble Round Table

Trained as an architect, Florence Knoll`s own pieces for Knoll are simple, architectural designs that stand the test of time. Her lounge seating, sofas, tables, and storage adapt flawlessly to any environment, with their clean, linear design and incredibly durable, high-quality construction. These pieces are built to last a lifetime - or several lifetimes. Not flashy pieces at all, Knoll said that her own work ""filled in the gaps"" for star pieces by Bertoia and Saarinen, but today we know that they stand in a class all by themselves.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Florence Knoll Walnut Credenza

"(1) Vintage Good Form Swivel Aluminum Arm Chair","MR10005","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 
The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Good Form Adjustable Aluminum Arm Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 24.5"" Depth x 30"" Height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Bill Stephens 

Bill Stephens started at Knoll as an assistant prototype builder after his graduation from the Philadelphia Museum School of Art. He first tried to make a cane chair on a minimal frame without success. He then changed the seat to a plastic shell that, when connected to the frame, formed a total structure; with this design innovation, the 1305U chair was born. It was originally designed for installation at the Yale School of Architecture student center. 

Fabric: 
Alexander Girard 

Alexander Girard (May 24, 1907 – 1993) affectionately known as Sandro, was an architect and a textile designer born in New York City to an American mother from Boston and a French-Italian father. He was raised in Florence, Italy. A graduate of the Royal School of Architecture in Rome, Girard refined his skills in both Florence and New York. 

Girard is widely known for his contributions in the field of American textile design, particularly through his work for Herman Miller (1952 to 1975), where he created fabrics for the designs of George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames. 

His work also includes designing the La Fonda del Sol Restaurant in New York (1960), the Herman Miller Showplace: T&O (Textiles and Objects) (1961), Braniff Airlines (1965). and the Girard Foundation (1962), which houses his extensive folk art collection. He and his wife, Susan Girard, amassed a remarkable collection of artifacts consisting of folk art, popular art, toys, and textiles from around the world, which is displayed through the Girard Foundation, founded 1962.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of 4 Bent Wood chairs by Bill Stephens for Knoll

A mid-century architect, Weese built primarily in the modern architectural style, but integrated other styles as he felt appropriate for the project. Because Weese believed that design was essentially problem-solving, he was willing to apply his skills to everything from a piece of furniture to an entire city. Weese is well known for his firm advocacy of historic preservation and was remembered as the architect who ""shaped Chicago’s skyline and the way the city thought about everything from the lakefront to its treasure-trove of historical buildings"". 
Weese produced a large number of significant designs ranging from small but highly inventive houses to large urban scale commissions like the Washington, D.C., Metro system. Although influenced to some degree by the rational, and often austere, work of European modernists like Mies van der Rohe, in most of his own bodies of work Weese instead followed the example of Nordic architects like Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto in favoring natural materials, human scale, and comfort; his work was characterized by a deep respect for older buildings and existing urban patterns and a fondness for unexpected, often idiosyncratic design decisions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","20.5""w x 19.5""h","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good vintage"

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Thonet Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Olive Burl Dining Table by Milo Baughman

"(2) Vintage Good Form Swivel Aluminum Chairs","MR10004","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 
The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Good Form Adjustable Aluminum Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17"" Width x 20"" Depth x 30"" Height

Burdicks first product for Herman Miller was the Burdick Group system, a unique assemblage of work surfaces, paper handling and storage elements, and electronic equipment supports, located along a structural armature in whatever configuration best suits the way people work. It can be arranged in many different sizes and configurations and can change and grow to reflect changing work patterns. The Burdick Group dining table offered by Herman Miller for the Home is one of the products in this line. Home office configurations are available as well. 

In 1980, the Burdick Group received design awards from the Institute of Business Designers and the Industrial Designers Society of America. The following year, Time magazine named the Burdick Group system one of the Best of 1981 for Industrial Design. The magazine described it as one of the first flexible office furniture systems to come to terms with computer terminals and other electronic office machines.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","This is a Herman Miller Burdick Group U Desk. The desk features one large writing/computer surface with 2 additional glass adjustable writing surfaces, detachable file/paper racks, a glass paper stand, and swiveling computer monitor mount. The desk features aluminum beams that support both the writing surfaces and hardware and three 3-Star leg bases. This is a great looking piece in beautiful condition, and would make a perfect addition to the modern office. 

The beams: The beam is the visual and structural base for any workstation. Beams and base assemblies carry energy and cables to components. Grouping related components on the beam create work zones, each zone supporting a different type of work. Most components are easily removed and re-mounted. Peninsula surfaces attach to beams to create meeting zones within workstations. Drawers, work surfaces, and all other components attach to the beam with brackets in one of three ways: They mount on top of, hang from, or cantilever from the beam.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Dimensions will vary depending on assembly.

American, 1894-1944 
It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. 
Then he met D. J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” 
he said. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. 
“You’re providing a way of life.” 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.
And with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of Eight Art Deco Dining Chairs Designed

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Eames Tan Fiberglass Side Shell Chair with your Choice of Base 1950

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Marcel Breuer`s revolutionary 1928 Cesca chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","19"" Width x 21"" Depth x 32"" Height

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Thonet Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Black Knoll Bertoia Mesh Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 21"" x Depth 18"" x Height 30.5""

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

An immediate classic upon its introduction in 1956 but a design in progress since his work with Charles Eames in the 1940 MOMA Organic Design contest, Saarinen`s objective was to clarify the furniture forms he designed. ""The undercarriage of chairs and tables makes an ugly, confusing, unrestful world. I wanted to clean up the slum of legs and make the chair all one thing again.""

"Vintage George Nelson Herman Miller Walnut Credenza and Desk Set SOLD","MR10679","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage George Nelson Credenza and Desk Set

Elias Svedberg is one of those many talented Swedish designers that made Scandinavian design known and appreciated far beyond Scandinavia. As a designer he is not all that well known because much of his work was pre-war (he was born in 1913) and most of his furniture was either project specific or made for the furniture division of NK (AB Nordiska Kompaniet) an influential department store chain in Sweden. NK`s reputation was such that they did not ""need"" to promote the fame of their designers.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dressing Table with attached Bench Designed by Elias Svedberg for NK","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Overall Dimensions

"64"" Wormley Edward Dining Table for Drexel","MR10539","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Drexel","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley
Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Wormley Edward Dining Table for Drexel","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","64.25"" length x 40"" depth x 30"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good vintage.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MR Coffee Table by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for Knoll

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 
One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.
Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchares whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dining Table by TH Robsjohn-Gibbings for Widdicomb and Set of (6) Dining Chairs

The company sold mahogany finished reproductions of 18th and 19th century English furniture. Small wooden furniture pieces such as occasional accent tables, plant stands and butlers’ tables were advertised in magazines and shipped to customers in boxes ready to be assembled, usually by just screwing on the legs.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of (10) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","22.75"" Width x 22.5"" Depth x 31"" Height

Harry Bertoia made a foray into furniture design in the 1950s with Knoll Associates that, while brief, was so powerful and enduring that the royalties alone from his series allowed him to turn his attention to sculpture for the rest of his life. Bertoia emigrated to America in 1930. He studied at the Cass Technical High School in Detroit and trained on a scholarship at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Michigan. From 1939 to 1943, he set up a metal workshop and began to teach jewelry and metal working. In 1943, he worked with Charles and Ray Eames for the Evans Product Company where they experimented on molded-plywood seating. In 1950, he established a studio in Pennsylvania and introduced his famous `Diamond` chair made of welded steel lattice work","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Bird Chair Ottoman

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

In another first, G-Plan was designed to be mixed and matched, and - another novelty in the post-World War II era - was also modern and affordable. As Scandinavian designs gained popularity, a Danish-designed range was added in the early-1960s. The success of G-Plan lead to E Gomme becoming one of the UK`s largest furniture manufacturers.

1922-2003 
Innovative designer and successful entrepreneur, Brooklyn-born Harvey Probber transformed the look of American furniture at mid-century. Known for his sleek modern lines and flexible modular units, Probber left an indelible stamp on the living rooms and dens of American families. The furniture he designed and produced for 40 years at his factory, Harvey Probber, Inc., first in New York and later in Fall River, Massachusetts, was elegant, up-to-date and beautifully adapted to the mobile, casual TV lifestyles that emerged in the U.S. during the post-World War II decades. 
Since Probber’s death in March of 2003, a re-evaluation of his design work and his influence on 20 th_ century style has begun. 
A self-taught modernist, Probber had virtually no artistic training when, at the age of 16, he designed his first piece—a sofa. “The key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry,” was how he characterized the source of his early inspirations. And it was those bits and pieces that led him to create the upholstered modular seating units that became a furniture industry phenomenon in the 1940s. Probber’s output, however, included much more, including the elegant sling-back chair displayed by MoMA as well as numerous tables and storage units. Later in his career, Probber turned his attention to office furniture, where his influence was as pervasive as it was in home design. Probber modified the severely functional modernist look by his use of fine fabrics, laminated surfaces and tribal-influenced woven materials. “Functional is not nearly enough,” was Probber’s credo. 
A creative force in modern design, Probber also knew what would sell and never forgot the needs of his customers. A popularizer as well as an innovator, he never strayed too far into the realm of the theoretical, one reason his work did not always receive the acclaim it deserved.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Round Harvey Probber coffee or gaming table

(October 3, 1923 - August 1985) 

Born in New Jersey, he moved to New York in 1940. 

Arthur H. Umunoff tried in his work to substantiate the thesis that the fundamentals of good design are in every way analogous to good homemaking. Accordingly, he works each item of furniture from the drawing board, through his own shop where he handled the raw materials directly, to actual use in his New York home with wife, Charlotte, and two young sons. As a partner in Post Modern, Ltd., which manufactured from his designs. Arthur had a hand in producing, merchandising, and selling, too. 

Some of his most interesting pieces are those which combine wrought iron and wood or laminated plastic: well sized desk (36x24x45), in birch, walnut or Formica; combination lamp table and magazine rack in the same materials. 

His most recognizable early work designs were for Shaver Howard. 

Umanoff`s work for Elton continues with the introduction of chairs, serving carts and a complete line of case pieces which get Elton and Umanoff chosen for the 1953 Good Design Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. 

The Umanoff designs for Elton (1953) were also featured for the 1954 Storage: Volume 4 of the Interiors Library series edited by George Nelson.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","66"" Vintage Arthur Umanoff Wrought Iron and Leather Wine Rack

British-born architect and furniture designer 
(1905 - 1976) 
Robsjohn-Gibbings studied architecture at London University. He afterwards worked briefly as a naval architect, designing ocean liner interiors, and then as art director for a motion picture studio. In 1926, he became a salesman for an antiques dealer who specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture, and Robsjohn-Gibbings was assigned prominent accounts such as Elizabeth Arden and Neiman Marcus. 
In the late 1930s and 1940s he was the most important decorator in America. After opening a shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936, Robsjohn-Gibbings proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such scions as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf, and Thelma Chrysler Foy. 
The design work of T. H. Robsjohn Gibbings is hallmarked as a modern mixture of the classical elements of Ancient Grecian design, and Art Deco design. It features mosaic floor reproductions, sculptural fragments, and sparse furnishings, all combining to achieve his trademark brand of modern historicism. 
T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings much preferred the visual vocabulary of the classical world, particularly ancient Greek furniture and design. Robsjohn-Gibbings` look was widely emulated, and, from 1943-56, he worked as a designer for the Widdicomb furniture company in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
In 1960, he met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, which drew heavily on classical forms. It is still in production. Robsjohn-Gibbings eventually moved to Athens, where he became designer to Aristotle Onassis. 
His honors include the 1950 Waters Award and the 1962 Elsie de Wolfe Award.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Robsjohn-Gibbings Dining Chairs

"48"" Herman Miller George Nelson Shelf Unit","MR10674","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","48"" Herman Miller George Nelson shelf system. Walnut and Aluminum wall-mounted shelves.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","48""w x 13""d x 48""h","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good.

"Pair TH Robsjohn Gibbings Arm Lounge Chairs","MR10693","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 
One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.
Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art DÃ©co style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Arm Lounge Chairs by T.H.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Norman Cherner studied and taught at the Columbia University Fine Arts Department and was an instructor at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from 1947 to 1949. At the same time he also began his practice, embarking on a lifetime exploration of multidisciplinary design. 

Although best known for his furniture design, his work included almost all aspects of design: from graphics, glassware and lighting, to his pioneering work in prefabricated housing. 

Having been educated in the Bauhaus tradition, he became interested in housing as industrial design. His first houses were built in 1948 for a cooperative in Ramapo, NY. These homes were examples of this total design concept and included affordable furniture designed specifically for these low-cost modular dwellings.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","6 Vintage Norman Cherner Plycraft Bent Wood Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17"" Width x 21"" Depth x 31"" Height

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of Three Milo Baughman Rosewood Bookcases

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Eames Brown Fabric Fiberglass Armchair

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960 they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 
Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their Bastiano set couch, lounge chair, tables were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the Coronado series of armchairs and the Soriana chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Tobia Scarpa Chrome Andre Dining Table

Born in Prague, Frankl together with his fellow European Joseph Urban, was one of the pioneering Modern designers working in America before 1925, who laid the foundations of the American tradition of modern decoration. After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Step Side Table By Paul Frankl","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","30"" width x 16"" depth x 22.5"" height

Milo Ray Baughman, Jr., was one of the leading modern furniture designers of the second-half of the 20th century. His uniquely American designs were forward-thinking and distinctive, yet unpretentious and affordable. His prolific and highly influential work continues to be copied, reinvented and revived in the new and secondary decorative arts markets by contemporary furniture designers and dealers alike. Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies starting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch Gordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and Drexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Two Piece Milo Baughman Sectional Sofa

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Desk1970s Design

American, 1894-1944 
It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. 
Then he met D. J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” 
he said. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. 
“You’re providing a way of life.” 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time. 
And with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of Six Art Deco Dining Chairs Designed","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Armchairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","42"" Vintage Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Dining Table

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Desk Chair by George Nelson for Herman Miller

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.

During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of 12 Teak Arne Jacobsen Series 7 Chairs for Fritz Hansen

"17"" Vintage Herman Miller Pedestal Side Table","MR10394","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller Pedestal Side Table

An American designer of modern furniture known for his restrained and somewhat conservative character, Wormley studied at the Art Institute of Chicago in the 1920s before specializing in furniture design in the 1930s, when he began a long-lasting relationship with the Dunbar furniture company of Berne, Indiana. After World War II, Wormley set up a private practice in interior and furniture design with Dunbar as his primary client. He used wood and upholstery in a tailored way that seemed comfortable to an audience not totally ready for the austerity of International Style design. Wormley often called his designs ""transitional"", and he did no hesitate to use forms as those of the ancient Greek Klismos chair. His Dunbar furniture was included in a number of ""Good Design"" exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edward Wormley for Dunbar Mahogany Adjustable Headboard

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Chrome Milo Baughman Arm Chairs

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(12) White Knoll Bertoia Mesh Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 21"" x Depth 18"" x Height 30.5""

"Vintage Art Deco Lloyd Loom Alfons Bach Coffee Side Table","MR10186","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Lloyd Loom FurnitureIn the early 1900s Marshall Burns Lloyd, an American, received several patents for his process of using loomed twisted kraft paper, partially reinforced with steel wire and woven to be stronger and more attractive than wicker. 
The new loomed woven fabric meant that a chair could be produced in a quarter of the time it took to make a rattan or wicker version. The end product was not only more beautiful but much more durable, as well. 
In America, Mr. Lloyd`s product became quite famous. His company was merged with Heywood-Wakefield, who went out of business in the 1980s.
The British Invasion
In Europe, the manufacturer in London purchased the rights and specialized equipment from Lloyd Manufacturing in 1921 and became hugely successful. But having been bombed in WWII, and the necessary materials for production unavailable due to the War effort, the company never recovered and discontinued operations in 1960. 
Over the years, Lloyd Loom British Woven Fibre Furniture has been seen on ocean liners, in hotels and tearooms; it became standard issue for the British Army and RAF all over the world; it even graced the Royal Boxes at Wimbledon, Henley and Twickenham and is often seen ""keeping the British end up"" at Royal functions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Alfons Bach

David Rowland studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, as well as Eero Saarinen attended school. Early in his career, Rowland trained with both Lazlo Moholy-Nagy, the great Bauhaus emigre, and Norman Bel Geddes, the innovative American designer who streamlined industrial design and its production process. This unique combination of sophisticated European avant-garde modern design and American technical know-how allowed Rowland to create some of the most unique and comfortable seating produced. 

After opening his own office in 1954, David Rowland pursued numerous experiments in minimal seating with the goal of accomodating large numbers of people. These exercises culminated with the much lauded 40/4 Chair, designed in 1963 and was immediately awarded the grand prize at the prestigous Milan Triennale the next year. 

David Rowland went on to design numerous other chairs that satisfy the rigorous demands of mass production while retaining a high level of design sophistication, but the 40/4 chair has never been surpassed, by Rowland or others.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","The original 40/4 stacking chair designed by David Rowland

Since its debut in 1964, the renowned 40/4 stacking chair has won an 
impressive assortment of design awards and unanimous acceptance as one of the most versatile and timeless chairs on the market. There is no secret to the success of the 40/4`s purposeful design and a well mannered use of strong, durable materials. 40/4, so named because 40 chairs stack four feet high. A smooth, tilted posture allows the chairs to be stacked and un-stacked quickly and easily.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Desk","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","6ft x 23.5"" Depth x 29"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

American, 1894-1944 
It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. 
Then he met D. J. DePree who had also a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. “This calls for a different kind of furniture,” 
he said. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You’re not making furniture anymore, “Rohde told DePree. 
“You’re providing a way of life.” 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (“rotorettes”) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place or a radical departure from the standard living or dining room “suites” purchased at the time.
And with the introduction of Rhode’s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Art Deco Extension Dining Table Designed","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","60"" width w/out leaves x 42"" depth x 29"" height

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 
Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Tobia Scarpa “Coronado” Chair By B&B Italia

Designed by Eero Saarinen for Knoll 


The design of Eero Saarinen`s Armchair (1950) began more than a decade earlier, when he and Charles Eames submitted several designs to the Organic Design in Home Furnishings competition at the MoMA. These fluid, sculptural shapes influenced the future work of both men; for Saarinen, most notably in his Womb, Tulip and Executive chairs. The Executive was originally made of fiberglass but was later updated in polyurethane. The molded shell flexes slightly with the sitter and the contoured plywood seat supported by metal or wood legs. Unlike Saarinen`s furniture, which was consistently sculptural in form, these fluid lines didn`t appear in his architecture until the 1950s.
