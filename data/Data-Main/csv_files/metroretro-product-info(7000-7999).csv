"Ward Bennett Brickel Yellow Plaid Side Chair","MR7373","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Brickel Associates","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ward Bennett Brickel Yellow Plaid Side Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","25"" Width x 24"" Depth x 32"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"
"Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Series Desk","MR7686","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Series Roll Up Tambour Desk

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Case Study Storage Unit
Originally produced from 1950 to 1955 
Suitable for office and residential use, these units were designed as storage and display spaces. 
The design resulted from work the Eameses did for a 1949 exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the molded plywood and wire supports echo other items designed by the Eameses.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Vintage Side Arm Chairs Set

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennetts projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ward Bennett Channel Back Lounge Chairs

Renowned for her work with stainless steel and enamel for Cathrineholm, her design has brought her numerous awards. Her jewelry designs in silver are particularly desirable today. Her success as a designer is no surprise given her family tradition in the field.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Library Index Card File Cabinet

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

He studied architecture at university in Tokyo from 1949, taking his degree in 1953. Kazuhide Takahama is, however, primarily known as a furniture and lighting designer. Kazuhide Takahama met furniture-maker Dino Gavina in Milan in 1957 and remained in Italy to design for Gavina`s firm. Kazuhide Takahama`s designs are distinguished by clarity of line and form, qualities that reveal his Japanese origins. He often combines traditional forms and techniques with Western elements in his designs. In 1957 Kazuhide Takahama designed the ""Naeko"" sofa bed for Gavina. In 1965 Kazuhide Takahama created ""Marcel"", ""Suzanne"", and ""Raymond"", seat furniture named after Marcel Breuer and his brother and sister. These Kazuhide Takahama pieces are made of large blocks of polyurethane foam in various combinations. A seating system on similar lines is ""ESA"", which Kazuhide Takahama designed in 1968. ""ESA"", however, is composed of hexagonal blocks of foam plastic, which can be assembled as desired or simply stacked. For Sirrah, Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Kazuki"" (1975), which can be either a floor lamp or table lamp. Its wire frame is covered in stretchable white jersey, a reminder that this is an adaption of the South-East Asian rice-paper lantern. In 1961 Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Gea"", a semicircular shelving system with lacquer-coated wood. The 1971 Kazuhide Takahama ""Kazuki"" chair is also made of straight, lacquered boards although the seat is leather-covered. In 1968 Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Acca"", a table with a glass top and aprons and substructure of black lacquered wood. In 1970 Kazuhide Takahama created the ""Olinto"" line in lacquer furniture for B&B Italia.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Sofa>97.5"" Width x 34.75"" Depth x 26.75"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good- Vintage

"Vintage Danish Teak Low Table Cabinet Thygesen Sørensen","MR7833","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Rud Thygesen & Johnny Sørensen 
When the Danish King Frederik IX shook hands with Rud Thygesen and Johnny Sørensen in 1970 in thanks for their 70th birthday gift, it launched a new era in the lives of the two young furniture designers. Until then, they had only just managed to eke out a living from their design studio, a lifelong dream, but following the royal handshake and photos in illustrated weeklies, their exclusive furniture collections attracted everyone’s attention, and the fairytale about the ‘King’s Furniture’ unfolded. 
Johnny Sørensen and Rud Thygesen have been showered with prizes, and not only for the King’s Furniture, because the studio has produced many more collections since the newly qualified designers resisted the general trend and struck out on their own as independent designers. One of their projects was the chairs they designed in the 1980s for Café Victor, a hip hang-out in downtown Copenhagen, and the two furniture designers still exhibit annually at the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers’ Autumn Exhibition independently of each other- just for the fun of it.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Danish Teak Short Cabinet Designed Thygesen Sørensen","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","32"" Length x 14"" Depth x 21"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Knoll Bertoia Full Cover for Side Chair Original Bertoia Full Brown Fabric Covers Price Is For (1) Brown Fabric Cover; Multiple Available CHAIR SOLD SEPARATELYClick Here For Original Knoll Harry Bertoia Side Chair Black","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Fits a regular side chair 21.75"" Width x 19.75"" Depth","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good VintageAge Appropriate Wear"

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Mid Century Modern Walnut Credenza Cabinet Set

Lauded for his modern yet timeless style, Pascal Mourgue’s product designs for both home and office illustrate his belief that utility and fine art are not mutually exclusive.

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Wire Side Occassional Table

"Herman Miller Gilbert Rohde Walnut Chest of Drawers","MR7827","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gilbert Rohde 
Designer Gilbert Rohde (1894-1944) was born and raised in New York, the son of a cabinetmaker. He left high school to pursue a variety of jobs, landing a short stint at a local paper, the Bronx News, drawing political cartoons. In 1923 he turned the experience into a job as an illustrator at the Abraham & Strauss department store. Inspired by a trip to the Paris Exhibition in 1925, Rohde began designing furniture and his early work was sold at Lord & Taylor. An exuberant modernist, his pieces gleaned simplicity and rationalism from Bauhaus design and a sense of form and ornamentation from Art Deco. He worked predominantly in Bakelite and chrome, the materials that made up the visual vocabulary of the period. 
Between 1927-28 Rohde designed the interiors for Avedon fashion stores, where his wife was part of the advertising team. Heywood-Wakefield of Massachusetts began picking up his designs in 1930, with a bentwood chair being one of their most successful pieces. Restless for a more substantial opportunity, he went west to Grand Rapids, Michigan where companies like John Widdicomb and Herman Miller had turned the city into a hub of furniture design and manufacturing. Rohde attracted the interest of Herman Miller and began designing for them in 1931. The company had been making traditional pieces and historical reproductions and was close to bankruptcy when they accepted Rohde`s modern work in a last ditch attempt to stay afloat. Apparently the miracle they needed, Rohde convinced them that modernism was the reigning style and proved it with his designs for bedroom furniture shown at the 1933 Chicago World`s Fair. Fortified by their updated image, Herman Miller had Rohde design entire sets for living and dining rooms and began making plans to halt their production of traditional pieces. Rohde designed a popular line of modular office furniture for Herman Miller, and they would later reintroduce the bentwood chair he made for Heywood-Wakefield. He also acted as the Design Director for several years.
During his tenure with Herman Miller Rohde was also pursuing a number of outside projects. He made a line of chrome chairs for the Troy Sunshade Company in 1933 and also worked some with Thonet. His designs were exhibited at the show of Machine Art at the MoMA in 1934 as well as at the Art and Industry show inside New York`s RCA building. In 1939 he exhibited work at the New York World`s Fair. He acted as the director of the Design Laboratory, also in New York, from 1935-38, and was the head of industrial design at the NYU School of Architecture from 1939-43.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Chest of drawers made by Herman Miller designed by Gilbert Rohde

James, Inc","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Milo Baughman 
(1925-) 
One of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 

In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record. 

In 1948 Baughman helped create the ""California Modern"" collection for Glenn of California, which also included pieces by Greta Magnusson Grossman. Their simple, understated designs—produced to order from Glenn and made mostly from walnut, formica and wrought iron—helped establish a Los Angeles style that became popular nationwide. An ad from the period noted that, ""You`ll be doubly pleased that such fine quality is so moderately priced."" Pieces created with the casual open-plan California architecture in mind, like his desk and shelving unit from this series, worked to create a division of space without walls. 

Although he is better known for his contributions to other companies, Baughman also ran his own custom design shop with Olga Lee in Los Angeles from 1951-1953. Lee contributed hand printed fabrics, wallpaper, lamps and accessories to go alongside Baughman`s furniture designs and they offered their services as interior consultants. 

In an article from the 1950`s Baughman sagely pronounced, ""Furniture that is too obviously designed is very interesting, but too often belongs only in museums."" Luckily, museums are now recognizing simple, accessible, good design and The Whitney Museum of American Art included Baughman`s 1948 Winchendon desk design in their ""High Styles: Twentieth Century American Design"" exhibition in 1985. He was initiated into the Furniture Designers Hall of Fame in 1987.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Thayer Coggin Original Recliner Lounge Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

It was March 1912, and a man named John Lane had purchased a box plant in Altavista, Virginia. His son Ed Lane, twenty-one at the time and with little manufacturing experience, was encouraged by his father to try his hand at starting a chest factory in the newly acquired plant. Since the Lanes didn`t know how successful their new venture was going to be, they didn`t want to put their name on it, so they incorporated the little company as the Standard Red Cedar Chest Company, with John Lane as President and Ed Lane as Vice President and General Manager. From cedar chests, Lane expanded to occasional tables in 1951, casegoods in 1956, and accent pieces in 1965.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Lane Furniture Breakfront Dresser

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Series I No. 6491 1965 Design ~Featutes~Walnut Roll TopFour DrawersFoot RestDeep Inner File SpaceConvenient Plug Attached Into The Storage Space Architonic 2004 auction price reached 8423 EUR  ~MULTIPLE DESKS AVAILABLE~","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","null","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Desk> Excellent Refinished"

Bruce Burdick was exposed early on to the industrial dynamics, creative lifestyle, and architectural activity of California. Born and raised in Los Angeles, he is a graduate of the University of Southern California and the Art Center College. While a junior at the Art Center, Burdick worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Eames Office. After completing his schooling, he worked with noted designers John Follis and Herb Rosenthal before opening his own office in 1970. 
Burdick`s early achievements include pioneering a new use of computers in exhibits on economics and nutrition. Both exhibits are permanently located at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. He has also been involved in the design and development of environmental education centers, a museum of oceanography, and the concept planning for the Institute of Automotive Science and History. 
His first product for Herman Miller was the Burdick Group system, a unique assemblage of work surfaces, paper handling and storage elements, and electronic equipment supports, located along a structural armature in whatever configuration best suits the way people work. It can be arranged in many different sizes and configurations and can change and grow to reflect changing work patterns. The Burdick Group dining table offered by Herman Miller for the Home is one of the products in this line. Home office configurations are available as well. 
In 1980, the Burdick Group received design awards from the Institute of Business Designers and the Industrial Designers Society of America. The following year, Time magazine named the Burdick Group system one of the Best of 1981 for Industrial Design. The magazine described it as one of the first flexible office furniture systems to come to terms with computer terminals and other electronic office machines.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Burdick Rectangular Work Surface Desk

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stendig Wassily Marcel Breuer Leather Chairs

"(1) Vintage Knoll Jens Risom Side Dining Chair","MR7637","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Jens Risom Side Dining Chair

Pascal Mourgue is above all else an artist. He graduated from Boulle school (sculpture) and Ensad (Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs). 
He began designing furniture in 1962, while continuing to be a prolific artist. Never openly seeking publicity, Pascal Mourgue has always prized artistic integrity above commercial achievement. This love of art has led him to work in fields as diverse as designing sailing boats for Cartier, crystal objects for Baccarat, architecture, painting and sculpture. It was not until the 1980s that he focused on furniture for the home. 
In 1994, a long standing and very fruitful collaboration was born between Pascal Mourgue and Ligne Roset. Calin was his first offering, based on the unusual concept of providing the same level of comfort in a sofa as in a pillow. 
His creations have achieved numerous accolades. The Lover won the Red Dot “best of the best” awards for Ligne Roset, and more recently the Downtown has followed suit.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Ligne Roset Offrande Occasional Table

""The paintings of Paul Jenkins have come to represent the spirit, vitality, and invention of post World War II American abstraction. Employing an unorthodox approach to paint application, Jenkins` fame is as much identified with the process of controlled paint-pouring and canvas manipulation as with the gem-like veils of transparent and translucent color which have characterized his work since the late 1950s. Born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1923, Jenkins was raised near Youngstown, Ohio. Drawn to New York, he became a student of Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Art Students League and ultimately became associated with the Abstract Expressionists, inspired in part by the ""cataclysmic challenge of Pollock and the total metaphysical consumption of Mark Tobey."" An ongoing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, the study of the I Ching, along with the writings of Carl Jung prompted Jenkins` turn toward inward reflection and mysticism which have dominated his aesthetic as well as his life.""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17.25"" Length x 20"" Height

"Vintage Stendig Mole Seating Suite Set Sergio Rodrigues","MR7948","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","STENDIG","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Sergio Rodrigues 

Sergio Rodrigues is the figure of illuminated characters, which has transformed its concerns in a consistent and eloquent work of Brazilian culture. Sergio is undoubtedly one of the most admirable expressions of design in our country. The single trait consistent and put your name in the history of 20th century design, especially the creation of a wide variety of products, the most famous is the Armchair Mole.
Next to masters like Jose Joaquim Tenreiro and Zanine Caldas, Sergio is making the Brazilian designer known internationally. While Tenreiro, with its mobile sober, was the forerunner in the search for a new style, Zanine wood pulled all of its expressive potential and Sergio Rodrigues has a wide experience in production, trying to think Brazil by design. He completely transformed the language of the mobile, was generous in the dash and the employment of native woods and, as well Lucio Costa said, ""with the creation of the OCA has the ambiance of the interior movement of renewal of our architecture."" 
The Brazilian production in this sector (furniture) in the mid-50s, was still prey to the very styles, and its renewal require two battles. Sergio knew that the only weapon that it was the design and that there was gone. 
Initially, as architect, worked alongside David Dobson, Flavio Regis do Nascimento and Olaf Redig Field project in the Civic Center in Curitiba, significant work in the context of modern Brazilian architecture. But, knowing their interests vigorously and trails for a path for other great architects like John Vilanova Artigas, Oscar Niemeyer, Oswaldo Bratke and Paulo Mendes da Rocha, Sergio jumped from architecture to the design of the mobile. 
Moreover, he was absolutely convinced that the ""architecture in the planning of internal space was not adequately studied architecture was not, it was sculpture."" 
For Lucio Costa, in some parts Sergio Rodrigues succeeded redeem the spirit of traditional furniture and also aspects of indigenous Australia. ""In fact, at that time he did the Brazil-Brazilian co-exist with Brazil-de-Ipanema, sung later (1962) by Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Morais in the famous"" Girl from Ipanema, ""and with Brazil`s Sao Paulo industrialization, Oca was actually the representative of selected models of the main factories of Sao Paulo. "" That is why the name Oca: a return to indigenous sources, the taste for traditional materials. Sergio immediately launched a search for permanent projects, methods and materials to meet adequately the needs of the user, unrelated to fashions and styles. According to Oscar Niemeyer: ""At that time (beginning of Brasilia) have not had time to think about designing mobile no. We use current mobile market, selecting the Palace as required. The main furniture designer who was asked Sergio Rodriguez."" At activities in the sector of furniture is fundamental to highlight the work of Sergio in the planning of interiors, the ambience, the scenery and decoration. Within the interior, cooperating with the most important architects Brazilians, and in his own store - The Oca - provided various consultancy in the country and abroad legitimizing the ""interior design"" in Brazil. 
""The accuracy of the mobile modern design with certain objects of Brazilian culture, and not concerned about fashions, accentuating the spirit of Brazilian Sergio Rodrigues that both search. These two facts were clear from the jury`s decision of the Fourth Biennial of Mobile, Cantu, Italy 1961, winning with the Sheriff Armchair between 400 candidates from 35 countries.

"Vintage Milo Baughman Bench","MR7626","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Milo Baughman 
(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Bench Restored

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Barcelona Chair Mies Van Der Rohe

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune. 
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Mid Century Dining Table

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Wassily Marcel Breuer Cow HideLounge ChairWassily Chair No.B3 (1925-1926)1920`s Design  ~This is the most copied of all Breuer`s chairs.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4ft Round Herman Miller Eames Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","48"" Diameter x 28"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

"(1) Knoll Style Bertoia Seat Cushion White New- Reproduction Velcro Strap","MR7128","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Harry Bertoia

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","White Bertoia Side Chair Cushion

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York’s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer’s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchares and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe’s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchares whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Product Sheet ""Mesa"" Coffee Table

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Vintage Side Arm Chairs Set

Rattan refers as 30`s and 40`s Tropical Deco for its streamline design and tropical flavor. Primarily found in warm climates such as Florida and California, rattan has found an exclusive clientele because of its casual elegance. In fact you can find vintage rattan in the homes of high profile celebrities such as Bruce Willis and Demi Moore to Madonna. 
Rattan speaks a language all its own. It is as strong as steel when braced, but when heated with steam becomes as pliable as a garden house. Designing in rattan is unlike designing in any other medium, as the structural features always remain in evidence.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Solid mahogany construction and tenon leg attachment","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","54.5"" Length X 19"" Width X 42"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Condition with nice patina- Marked on Underside"

""Modern Management Group""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Turquoise Modern Management Group Desk

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","SET SERIES 7 SIDE CHAIR BY ARNE JACOBSEN

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Caramel Bertoia Side Chair Cushion

Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates. A number of Saarinen`s chairs for Knoll were to become landmarks in the history of 20th century design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Saarinen Round Coffee Table

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Mid Century Modern Original Knoll Bertoia Cushion ~Features~(2) Black Vinyl Cushion With Black Vinyl Trim(4) Black Fabric Cushion With Black Vinyl Trim(2) Red Vinyl Cushion With Red Vinyl Trim(3) Red Fabric Cushion With Red Vinyl Trim ~Cushions Are Designed For Bertoia Side Chair As Shown In 4th Picture~ PRICE IS PER CUSHION","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17.5"" Width x 15.5"" Depth","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good VintageAge Appropriate Wear"

Lino Sabattini, a brilliant but entirely self-taught Italian designer, was a leading designer of cutlery and tableware. His designs are beautiful, elegant, and distinguished by consummate craftsmanship. It was thanks to Gio Ponti, who raved about Lino Sabattini`s designs, that Sabattini became known to a wide following. In 1956 Gio Ponti presented Lino Sabattini`s metal objects in ""Domus"". This visual presentation was followed that same year by an exhibition Gio Poni organized for Lino Sabattini in Paris. Lino Sabattini became director of design at the prestigious Christofle Orfèvrerie, where he created metalware notable for abstract organic yet invariably elegant and modern forms between 1956 and 1963. During that period, Lino Sabattini also designed metal, glass, and ceramic objects for Rosenthal, Nava, and Zani&Zani. In Bregnano, south of Como, Lino Sabattini established Argenteria Sabattini (1964) to execute his designs in limited editions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Lino Sabattini Vase Candlestick

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Conant Ball Russel Wright Birch Dresser

(1927-) 

Architect, installation artist, lighting and interior designer and provoking theoretician Gae Aulenti was born in Palazzolo della Stella, Udine in Italy. One of the few well recognized women working in Italy in the hotbed of postwar design, Aulenti made a name for herself with a broad spectrum of unfailingly elegant and innovative work. 
Aulenti was formally trained as an architect at the Milan Polytechnic, graduating in 1954. From 1954 to 1962 she worked doing graphic design for and serving on the editorial staff of Casabella Continuita. She also served on the directorial board of the later ""Lotus International"" magazine. During the early sixties she was involved in a number of diverse projects in Italy. From 1960-62 she taught at the Venice School of Architecture and from 1964-67 she taught at the Milan School of Architecture. Like many of her contemporaries, she designed series of furniture throughout the sixties for the department store, La Rinascente. Aulenti was awarded first prize at the 1964 Milan Triennial for her work in the Italian Pavilion. A distinctly feminine presence at the Triennial, her evocative ""Arrivo al Mare"" installation had mirrored walls decorated with cutout silhouettes of women inspired by those in the paintings of Picasso. She would go on to serve on the Executive Board of the Triennial from 1977-80. She was also establishing a long and successful relationship designing furniture for Zanotta. Two of her best known pieces for them, spanning her career, are the 1964 ""April"" folding chair which was stainless steel with a removable cover, and her 1984 plate-glass ""Sanmarco"" table. From 1966-69 she served as the vice-president of the Association for Industrial Design. 
In the seventies she began creating set designs and she worked from 1976-78 with the Prato Theater Design Workshop. In 1972 as part of the ""Italy: The New Domestic Landscape"" show at the MoMA, Aulenti designed one of the ""environments,"" a divided room punctuated by pyramidal shapes at each corner. Her aim was to create furniture that would appear in a room as buildings on a skyline and remind the viewer of ""the interaction between objects of design and architectural space."" Aulenti also wrote the accompanying essay to the project, outlining her belief that the ""conscious principle in this design has been to achieve forms that could create experiences, and that could at the same time welcome everyone’s experiences with the serenity of an effortless development."" Throughout her career Aulenti’s public architecture and design is augmented by her keen theoretical studies of the work. However, she maintained a modest and very personal view of the elements of home design, believing that the inhabitant makes the space. In an interview in a 1970 issue of Vogue her ""advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values."" 
Aulenti’s work in the eighties included several large-scale museum projects. For her layout of the Musée d’Orsay in Paris (1980-86) she was named Chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur by the French government. She also designed the Contemporary Art Gallery at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1982-85), and the Palazzo Grassi in Venice (1985-86).","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","56T Knoll Gae Aulenti Jumbo Rosso Marble Coffee Table MR

(1885-1961) 

Warren McArthur, whose furniture helped define the glamour of 1930s Art Deco curves. Warren McArthur, a mechanical engineer by training, registered several patents for furniture construction methods using standardized aluminum parts. Over the span of his career, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production. He created a system of aluminum furniture in which no spot welding was used in the construction. All the components were fitted and screwed together. The joints where the tubes intersect were defined by a series of exterior aluminum rings. The design is an example of seamless construction. His furniture is mostly recognizable for their curved tubing and the way he used rounded edges almost more prevalently than right angles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Warren McArthur Aluminum Chair

"Veil Before Paul Jenkins Print Abstract Lithograph Framed Art","MR7935","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Veil Before Paul Jenkins Print Abstract Lithograph 

""The paintings of Paul Jenkins have come to represent the spirit, vitality, and invention of post World War II American abstraction. Employing an unorthodox approach to paint application, Jenkins` fame is as much identified with the process of controlled paint-pouring and canvas manipulation as with the gem-like veils of transparent and translucent color which have characterized his work since the late 1950s. Born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1923, Jenkins was raised near Youngstown, Ohio. Drawn to New York, he became a student of Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Art Students League and ultimately became associated with the Abstract Expressionists, inspired in part by the ""cataclysmic challenge of Pollock and the total metaphysical consumption of Mark Tobey."" An ongoing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, the study of the I Ching, along with the writings of Carl Jung prompted Jenkins` turn toward inward reflection and mysticism which have dominated his aesthetic as well as his life.""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17.25"" Length x 20"" Height

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 
From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 
In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Scandinavian Artek Alvar Aalto Bench Table 153A

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Wassily Marcel Breuer Chair

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Mid Century Modern Original Knoll Bertoia Cushion","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17.5"" Width x 15.5"" Depth","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Like so many of her groundbreaking designs that became the gold standard for the industry, the 1961 executive collection, including the series of credenzas, made there way into the pantheon of modern classics. Florence Knoll’s designs are reserved and cool, severe and angular, reflecting the objective perfectionism of the early 1960s. 
While a student on the campus of the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Florence Knoll Bassett became a protegée of Eero Saarinen. She worked briefly for Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and Wallace K. Harrison. In 1946, she married Hans Knoll, after which they formed Knoll Associates. As a pioneer of the Knoll Planning Unit, she revolutionized interior space planning with her belief in ""total design"" – embracing all aspects of design principles  which were radical departures from the standard practice in the 1950s, but were quickly adopted and remain widely used today. For her extraordinary contributions to architecture and design, Florence Knoll was accorded the National Endowment for the Arts` prestigious 2002 National Medal of Arts.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Steel frame, rosewood veneer body with calacutta gold marble top.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","37.5"" Length x 18"" Depth x 25.5"" Height"

"sold Herman Miller Children George Nelson Desk","MR7302","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Children George Nelson Desk","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.25"" Width x 47.75"" Depth x 25.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good Original Vintage"

He studied architecture at university in Tokyo from 1949, taking his degree in 1953. Kazuhide Takahama is, however, primarily known as a furniture and lighting designer. Kazuhide Takahama met furniture-maker Dino Gavina in Milan in 1957 and remained in Italy to design for Gavina`s firm. Kazuhide Takahama`s designs are distinguished by clarity of line and form, qualities that reveal his Japanese origins. He often combines traditional forms and techniques with Western elements in his designs. In 1957 Kazuhide Takahama designed the ""Naeko"" sofa bed for Gavina. In 1965 Kazuhide Takahama created ""Marcel"", ""Suzanne"", and ""Raymond"", seat furniture named after Marcel Breuer and his brother and sister. These Kazuhide Takahama pieces are made of large blocks of polyurethane foam in various combinations. A seating system on similar lines is ""ESA"", which Kazuhide Takahama designed in 1968. ""ESA"", however, is composed of hexagonal blocks of foam plastic, which can be assembled as desired or simply stacked. For Sirrah, Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Kazuki"" (1975), which can be either a floor lamp or table lamp. Its wire frame is covered in stretchable white jersey, a reminder that this is an adaption of the South-East Asian rice-paper lantern. In 1961 Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Gea"", a semicircular shelving system with lacquer-coated wood. The 1971 Kazuhide Takahama ""Kazuki"" chair is also made of straight, lacquered boards although the seat is leather-covered. In 1968 Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Acca"", a table with a glass top and aprons and substructure of black lacquered wood. In 1970 Kazuhide Takahama created the ""Olinto"" line in lacquer furniture for B&B Italia","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Kazuhide Takahama Suzanne Lounge Chair

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Oak Arm Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","25.5"" Width x 25"" Depth x 32"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Original Vintage"

"Herman Miller George Nelson Rosewood Credenza SOLD","MR7209","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson’s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World’s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Credenza File Cabinet","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","74.5"" Width x 20"" Depth x 29"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good- Vintage

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

"Brickel Ward Bennett Wood Leather Two Tier Side Table SOLD","MR7674","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Brickel Associates INC.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett
Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. Herman Miller recently acquired the company.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Brickel Ward Bennett Wood Leather Two Tier Side Table

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Desk

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 

The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 

Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick. Le Corbusier`s built oeuvre comprises about 60 buildings, and many would argue he was more gifted.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Le Corbusier LC2 Chair

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Knoll Wassily Marcel Breuer Leather Lounge Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","31"" Width x 28"" Depth x 28"" HeightSeat Height 16.5""Arm Height 23""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","8 ft Herman Miller Eames Conference Table

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Studio Brno Side Chair 
1920`s Design 
The Brno chair (model number MR50) is a modernist cantilever chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1929-1930 for the bedroom of the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. The design was based on similar chairs created by Mies van der Rohe working with Lilly Reich, such as the MR20 chair with wicker seat from 1927; all building on earlier designs of Mart Stam. 
The Brno chair has become a modern furniture Classic. It has very clean lines, consisting of a steel frame in a single piece, bent into a C-shape from the middle of the back, round past the front edge of seat (to create arms), and back under the seat to create a cantilever, with taut seat and back upholstered. There are two versions of the chair, one in tubular steel and the other in flat steel. The metal was originally polished stainless steel; some modern examples are chrome plated 
The Brno chair was selected by Dan Cruickshank as one of his 80 man-made ""treasures"" in the 2005 BBC series, Around the World in 80 Treasures","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","22 3/4"" Width x 22 1/2"" Depth x 31 1/2"" Height

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Square Tobia Scarpa Chrome Andre Dining Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","54"" Length x 54"" Depth x 29.75"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Studio Brno Side Chair1920`s Design  The Brno chair (model number MR50) is a modernist cantilever chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1929-1930 for the bedroom of the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. The design was based on similar chairs created by Mies van der Rohe working with Lilly Reich, such as the MR20 chair with wicker seat from 1927; all building on earlier designs of Mart Stam.The Brno chair has become a modern furniture Classic. It has very clean lines, consisting of a steel frame in a single piece, bent into a C-shape from the middle of the back, round past the front edge of seat (to create arms), and back under the seat to create a cantilever, with taut seat and back upholstered. There are two versions of the chair, one in tubular steel and the other in flat steel. The metal was originally polished stainless steel; some modern examples are chrome platedThe Brno chair was selected by Dan Cruickshank as one of his 80 man-made ""treasures"" in the 2005 BBC series, Around the World in 80 Treasures ~Features~Flat Bar Stainless Steel FrameBurnt Orange Original Upholstery ~Price is per 1 chair~Multiple Chairs Available","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23"" Width x 22"" Depth x 32"" HeightSeat height 18""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Original Vintage"

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","6 Ft George Nelson Herman Miller Rosewood Credenza","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Very Good Original Vintage","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","74.25"" Width/ Length x 19"" Depth x 27"" Height"

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Mid Century Side Tables Night Stands","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18"" Width x 34"" Depth x 22.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good- Vintage"

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Bertoia Vintage Black Side Chair Cover

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Van Der Rohe Brno Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 24"" x Depth 25"" x Height 31""

Warren McArthur, whose furniture helped define the glamour of 1930s Art Deco curves. Warren McArthur, a mechanical engineer by training, registered several patents for furniture construction methods using standardized aluminum parts. Over the span of his career, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production. He created a system of aluminum furniture in which no spot welding was used in the construction. All the components were fitted and screwed together. The joints where the tubes intersect were defined by a series of exterior aluminum rings. The design is an example of seamless construction. His furniture is mostly recognizable for their curved tubing and the way he used rounded edges almost more prevalently than right angles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Warren McArthur Aluminum Chair

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","USA

"Milo Baughman Serving Cart Extension Table Burl Chrome","MR7792","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Milo Baughman 
Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Extension Serving Cart

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 

The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 

Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick. Le Corbusier`s built oeuvre comprises about 60 buildings, and many would argue he was more gifted.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Le Corbusier Basculant Sling LC1 Chairs

An early printed reference to the chair occurs in an 1890 New York Times article describing the furnishings of a Pullman parlor car. By the turn of the century, Bank of England seats and arms were mounted on swivel bases with casters and were some of the most fashionable desk chairs. The Bank of England chair was associated not only with financial institutions but with courts and other formal places; Yale Law School ordered many at the turn of the century. At Princeton the chairs were used for faculty seating, and remained evident well after World War II. A few turn up today in lecture halls and public rooms, but by the early 20th century, lecture halls in new buildings had built-in oak seats with writing arms. The Bank of England chair remains one of the best seats for preceptors and seminars tough but comfortably contoured.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 23"" Depth 31"" Height

Warren McArthur(1885-1961), whose furniture helped define the glamour of 1930s Art Deco curves, grew up in an environment steeped in support for the advancements of the new age of technology and design. Raised in Chicago, his father was one of the first locals to own a car, and, in 1892, hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design their house. When McArthur moved to Arizona to form what would be a series of business ventures introducing modern aesthetics and philosophies to the Phoenix area, his father funded almost every project. With this support, both financial and inspirational, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Warren McArthur Folding Chair

He studied architecture at university in Tokyo from 1949, taking his degree in 1953. Kazuhide Takahama is, however, primarily known as a furniture and lighting designer. Kazuhide Takahama met furniture-maker Dino Gavina in Milan in 1957 and remained in Italy to design for Gavina`s firm. Kazuhide Takahama`s designs are distinguished by clarity of line and form, qualities that reveal his Japanese origins. He often combines traditional forms and techniques with Western elements in his designs. In 1957 Kazuhide Takahama designed the ""Naeko"" sofa bed for Gavina. In 1965 Kazuhide Takahama created ""Marcel"", ""Suzanne"", and ""Raymond"", seat furniture named after Marcel Breuer and his brother and sister. These Kazuhide Takahama pieces are made of large blocks of polyurethane foam in various combinations. A seating system on similar lines is ""ESA"", which Kazuhide Takahama designed in 1968. ""ESA"", however, is composed of hexagonal blocks of foam plastic, which can be assembled as desired or simply stacked. For Sirrah, Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Kazuki"" (1975), which can be either a floor lamp or table lamp. Its wire frame is covered in stretchable white jersey, a reminder that this is an adaption of the South-East Asian rice-paper lantern. In 1961 Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Gea"", a semicircular shelving system with lacquer-coated wood. The 1971 Kazuhide Takahama ""Kazuki"" chair is also made of straight, lacquered boards although the seat is leather-covered. In 1968 Kazuhide Takahama designed ""Acca"", a table with a glass top and aprons and substructure of black lacquered wood. In 1970 Kazuhide Takahama created the ""Olinto"" line in lacquer furniture for B&B Italia.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Kazuhide Takahama Suzanne Sofa 53S3

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple.

"(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Stools","MR7459","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Black Stools

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","10 Ft Herman Miller Eames Walnut Conference Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","120"" Width/ Length x 54"" Depth x 25"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Restored"

Philippe Starck was born in Paris on 18th January 1949 the son of an aircraft designer, it is he who probably inspired the young Starck. Even at a very early age Starck showed enthusiasm for design. Starck lives and works in Paris. 
Much of his work produced in the 1980`s and 1990`s was influenced by fashion and novelty. Some as being `overdesigned` has even referred it to. In the 21st century his approach to design seems to have changed. 
Products designed by Starck can be seen on display in the collections of a number of European and American museums, among them the Brooklyn Museum in New York, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Museum of Design in London. Exhibitions of his work, either alone or in conjunction with that of other designers, have been held, among other places, in Paris, Marseille, Rome, Munich, Düsseldorf, Kyoto, Tokyo, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Italian Kartell Starck Philippe Ero[s] Armchair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Wire Side Occasional Tables

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Walnut Credenza","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","67.5"" Length x 18.5"" Depth x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Refinished"

"Le Corbusier LC6 Dining Conference Table Base","MR7941","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Le Corbusier

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 

The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 

Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick. Le Corbusier`s built oeuvre comprises about 60 buildings, and many would argue he was more gifted.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Le Corbusier LC6 Dining Conference Table Base

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair (2) Platner Lounge Chairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Eames H M Soft Pad Management Chair Leather","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23"" Width x 17.5"" Depth x 34"" Height

"Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Prost Desk","MR7524","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Robert Propst 

A native of Colorado, Propst began his career in the late 1940s as a graphic artist, teacher, and sculptor. In 1953, he formed the Propst Co., a Denver-based firm specializing in speculative product development. In other words, Propst drew on his independent nature and impatience with the status quo to attack problems, whether anyone asked him to or not. He called on Herman Miller with one of those speculative developments - a unique fishbone connection system for furniture components. Propst then signed on as a Herman Miller consultant and began conducting unprecedented studies of people in work situations as a basis for extending the company`s line of products. 

In 1960, Propst became president of Herman Miller Research Corp., where he continued investigating how the world of work operates, concluding that `today`s office is a wasteland. It saps vitality, blocks talent, frustrates accomplishment. It is the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort.` 

Propst`s answer to this unhappy situation was introduced by Herman Miller in 1968. The Action Office system was the world`s first open-plan office system of reconfigurable components and a bold departure from the era`s fixed assumptions of what office furniture should be. With the Action Office system, Propst assailed traditional, complacent office design with a concept that fit the way people really work. Wildly successful, the Action Office system transformed the workplace, as well as Herman Miller and the entire furniture industry, which scrambled to copy it. 

In the early 1960s, Propst also initiated research into the troubled state of patient care delivery in hospitals. As usual, he came up with a revolutionary solution, introduced in 1971 by Herman Miller. The Co/Struc system streamlined hospital services with mobile and modular containers, carts, frames, and rails. 

With over 120 patents under his belt, Propst continues his relentless investigations today, still impatient with the status quo, still inventing systems that make life better.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Action Office

~In 1968, Herman Miller introduced the fruit of Propst`s 10-year effort to rethink the office: the first panel-based office furniture system in the world. More than 30 years later, a $5 billion installed base and a continuing demand for the Action Office system have proven his original ideas sound~

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Russel Wright Dining Set","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Dining Table:

"4.5ft Herman Miller George Nelson Walnut Headboard","MR7532","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller George Nelson Walnut Headboard","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","54"" Width x 1.5"" Depth x 31"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames DCM Side Chair

Lino Sabattini, a brilliant but entirely self-taught Italian designer, was a leading designer of cutlery and tableware. His designs are beautiful, elegant, and distinguished by consummate craftsmanship. It was thanks to Gio Ponti, who raved about Lino Sabattini`s designs, that Sabattini became known to a wide following. In 1956 Gio Ponti presented Lino Sabattini`s metal objects in ""Domus"". This visual presentation was followed that same year by an exhibition Gio Poni organized for Lino Sabattini in Paris. Lino Sabattini became director of design at the prestigious Christofle Orfèvrerie, where he created metalware notable for abstract organic yet invariably elegant and modern forms between 1956 and 1963. During that period, Lino Sabattini also designed metal, glass, and ceramic objects for Rosenthal, Nava, and Zani&Zani. In Bregnano, south of Como, Lino Sabattini established Argenteria Sabattini (1964) to execute his designs in limited editions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Lino Sabattini Vase

J. B. Mersman was a 19th century sawyer with mills in Angola and Kendallville in extreme northeastern Indiana. He relocated his operations across the state line to Ottoville, Ohio where he started making tables around 1876 under the name Mersman Tables when the lumber business turned soft. From his first table he went on to make beds and bed parts. So successful was he that the nearby city of Celina, OH solicited him to build a factory there and provided $7500 of seed money for the operation. That turned out to be a good investment by the city fathers. He was up and running in Celina by 1900 making beds, library tables and dining tables.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Mersman Side Tables

"(2) Vintage Swivel Ward Bennett Lounge Arm Chairs","MR7384","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett
Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Vintage Swivel Ward Bennett Lounge Arm Chairs

"4ft Herman Miller Action Nelson Computer Table Desk","MR7866","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Robert Propst 

A native of Colorado, Propst began his career in the late 1940s as a graphic artist, teacher, and sculptor. In 1953, he formed the Propst Co., a Denver-based firm specializing in speculative product development. In other words, Propst drew on his independent nature and impatience with the status quo to attack problems, whether anyone asked him to or not. He called on Herman Miller with one of those speculative developments - a unique fishbone connection system for furniture components. Propst then signed on as a Herman Miller consultant and began conducting unprecedented studies of people in work situations as a basis for extending the company`s line of products. 

In 1960, Propst became president of Herman Miller Research Corp., where he continued investigating how the world of work operates, concluding that `today`s office is a wasteland. It saps vitality, blocks talent, frustrates accomplishment. It is the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort.` 

Propst`s answer to this unhappy situation was introduced by Herman Miller in 1968. The Action Office system was the world`s first open-plan office system of reconfigurable components and a bold departure from the era`s fixed assumptions of what office furniture should be. With the Action Office system, Propst assailed traditional, complacent office design with a concept that fit the way people really work. Wildly successful, the Action Office system transformed the workplace, as well as Herman Miller and the entire furniture industry, which scrambled to copy it. 

In the early 1960s, Propst also initiated research into the troubled state of patient care delivery in hospitals. As usual, he came up with a revolutionary solution, introduced in 1971 by Herman Miller. The Co/Struc system streamlined hospital services with mobile and modular containers, carts, frames, and rails. 

With over 120 patents under his belt, Propst continues his relentless investigations today, still impatient with the status quo, still inventing systems that make life better.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Action Office

More than 30 years later, a $5 billion installed base and a continuing demand for the Action Office system have proven his original ideas sound~

After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Tobia Scarpa Chrome Andre Dining Table

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Barcelona Base Mies Van Der Rohe Custom Made Coffee Table

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Lino Sabattini, a brilliant but entirely self-taught Italian designer, was a leading designer of cutlery and tableware. His designs are beautiful, elegant, and distinguished by consummate craftsmanship. It was thanks to Gio Ponti, who raved about Lino Sabattini`s designs, that Sabattini became known to a wide following. In 1956 Gio Ponti presented Lino Sabattini`s metal objects in ""Domus"". This visual presentation was followed that same year by an exhibition Gio Poni organized for Lino Sabattini in Paris. Lino Sabattini became director of design at the prestigious Christofle Orfèvrerie, where he created metalware notable for abstract organic yet invariably elegant and modern forms between 1956 and 1963. During that period, Lino Sabattini also designed metal, glass, and ceramic objects for Rosenthal, Nava, and Zani&Zani. In Bregnano, south of Como, Lino Sabattini established Argenteria Sabattini (1964) to execute his designs in limited editions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Lino Sabattini Vase Candlestick

"(2) Jindrich Halabala Cantilever Zidle H Armchair Steel","MR7014","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jindrich Halabala (1903-1978)Jindrich Halabala helped create a new mass-market approach to home design and furnishing in Czechoslovakia in the interwar period and after the Second World War. He believed furniture could and should be well-finished, fully functional, modular, mobile and widely affordable. As chief designer of the large Brno-based furniture producer United Arts and Crafts Manufacture (UP), he significantly influenced its manufacturing programme from the 1930s on – pioneering the industrial manufacture of furniture in Czechoslovakia. He developed two fundamental series of modular furniture: lines H and E, and many types of wooden seating. He also designed innovative tubular steel furniture, produced in UP`s Hodonín branch. As well as developing a modern approach to promotion of furniture, using life-like interiors that he photographed himself for UP publicity materials, he was also active as a theoretician. He regularly contributed to specialist journals and the general press, lectured at vocational secondary schools and colleges and later, as chairman of the furniture manufacturers` association, played a major part in the reshaping of the Czech furniture industry. Furniture with the UP mark or individual pieces of furniture attributable to Jindrich Halabala are much sought after today. Apart from cupboards, tables and small armchairs, the greatest demand is for Halabala`s reclinable bent wood armchair (several variants with different systems for reclining), writing desks and dining-room chairs with a high, spreading back. Halabala`s unique tubular chairs with a two-way cantilever or a loop armrest are top collectors` pieces but hardly ever reach the market as they were originally produced in very limited quantities.Halabala`s designs can be seen in the permanent collections of Die Neue Sammlung in Munich, Moravská galerie, Brno and the Olomouc Museum of Art, and have recently been on show in an exhibition commemorating Halabala`s centenary that has toured major cities of the Czech Republic.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jindrich Halabala Cantilever Armchair Steel Leather1930`s Design  ~Features~Tubular Steel Black Leather Side Chairs >Part of the DOROTHEUM Auction Catalog.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Knoll Bertoia Full Cushion and Black Diamond Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 33.5"" x Depth 28"" x Height 30.5""

Lino Sabattini, a brilliant but entirely self-taught Italian designer, was a leading designer of cutlery and tableware. His designs are beautiful, elegant, and distinguished by consummate craftsmanship. It was thanks to Gio Ponti, who raved about Lino Sabattini`s designs, that Sabattini became known to a wide following. In 1956 Gio Ponti presented Lino Sabattini`s metal objects in ""Domus"". This visual presentation was followed that same year by an exhibition Gio Poni organized for Lino Sabattini in Paris. Lino Sabattini became director of design at the prestigious Christofle Orfèvrerie, where he created metalware notable for abstract organic yet invariably elegant and modern forms between 1956 and 1963. During that period, Lino Sabattini also designed metal, glass, and ceramic objects for Rosenthal, Nava, and Zani&Zani. In Bregnano, south of Como, Lino Sabattini established Argenteria Sabattini (1964) to execute his designs in limited editions.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Lino Sabattini Vase Candlestick

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","No. 8102 MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

"Herman Miller Kiva Pebble Extender Work Table Eric Chan","MR7937","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Eric Chan 

Born in China, Chan grew up in Hong Kong and strongly believes in the Eastern philosophy of creating harmony between man, nature, and society. But as an industrial designer living in New York, he recognizes that technology has also become part of the equation. And therein lies his challenge. 
""More than ever, the designer`s task is to mediate the balance between people and objects, poetry and logic, technology and nature,"" says Chan, who received his master`s degree in design from Cranbrook Academy of Art. ""I am most interested in translating complicated technology into simple, understandable, and friendly products for people."" 
Chan says his education at Cranbrook Arts Academy taught him how to enjoy rethinking and improving everyday objects--an ergonomic telephone, a more comfortable pair of scissors, a toothbrush that`s easier to hold--always striving to achieve what he calls the ""aah"" experience, where everything comes together, creating beauty in both form and function. 
Chan understands, too, that marketing plays an important role in the process. ""We`re not in business to place products in museums,"" he says. ""If beautiful forms are meaningful in the marketplace, that`s when we`ve done our jobs. Design must be aimed at superior performance, aesthetic appeal, and marketing success."" 
Also an inventor, Chan holds a number of patents and has earned awards in over 20 design competitions and exhibitions throughout the world. One particularly innovative product: a venetian blind that converts solar energy into light. 
In approaching the design of any product, Chan first examines the world around it. Before he began designing furniture for Herman Miller, he spent a good deal of time simply watching people work. ""We observed their behavior and how they interact with others and asked `How can we use technology to enhance this process?`"" 
From his observations came the Kiva Collection, designed not only to let people work more naturally, productively, and safely, but most importantly, he says, ""to allow workers to control their own way of working."" 
Chan is also interested in creating more harmony between work and home. ""Technology allows us to travel and be more mobile, but is it really all that enjoyable or even natural?"" he asks. 
""It`s easy to lose track of the meaning of the simple life,"" says Chan. ""We don`t need a lot to survive and be happy. I`m not sure more technology is the right answer, but the right technology can help us find new answers, and even, perhaps, simplicity.""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Kiva Collection Pebble Table By Eric Chan","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","54"" Width x 28"" Depth x 29"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent refinished"

A native of Colorado, Propst began his career in the late 1940s as a graphic artist, teacher, and sculptor. In 1953, he formed the Propst Co., a Denver-based firm specializing in speculative product development. In other words, Propst drew on his independent nature and impatience with the status quo to attack problems, whether anyone asked him to or not. He called on Herman Miller with one of those speculative developments - a unique fishbone connection system for furniture components. Propst then signed on as a Herman Miller consultant and began conducting unprecedented studies of people in work situations as a basis for extending the company`s line of products. 

In 1960, Propst became president of Herman Miller Research Corp., where he continued investigating how the world of work operates, concluding that `today`s office is a wasteland. It saps vitality, blocks talent, frustrates accomplishment. It is the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort.` 

Propst`s answer to this unhappy situation was introduced by Herman Miller in 1968. The Action Office system was the world`s first open-plan office system of reconfigurable components and a bold departure from the era`s fixed assumptions of what office furniture should be. With the Action Office system, Propst assailed traditional, complacent office design with a concept that fit the way people really work. Wildly successful, the Action Office system transformed the workplace, as well as Herman Miller and the entire furniture industry, which scrambled to copy it. 

In the early 1960s, Propst also initiated research into the troubled state of patient care delivery in hospitals. As usual, he came up with a revolutionary solution, introduced in 1971 by Herman Miller. The Co/Struc system streamlined hospital services with mobile and modular containers, carts, frames, and rails. 

With over 120 patents under his belt, Propst continues his relentless investigations today, still impatient with the status quo, still inventing systems that make life better.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Action Office

(1902-1981)
Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work.
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts.
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Wassily Marcel Breuer Leather

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

"Herman Miller Desk Work End Table Geoff Hollington","MR7471","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Geoff Hollington 
Geoff Hollington picks up his fresh, black Edding 55 fibre-tip pen and draws a little square in the top right corner of a clean, white sheet of A4-size copier paper. The square will enclose the date, the project code, and the sheet number for his next design. Creating the square is a ritual that redefines the paper as a field for ideas. Repeated for countless sheets of unmarked A4-sized copier paper, the ritual itself becomes the first step of each design. 
The ritual is characteristic of Hollington`s attention to details. He thinks about how the handle will feel when a person opens a drawer on a Relay desk. He knows what he wants a person to experience when they use any of the Relay line of products available from Herman Miller for the Home. Geoff encourages a sense of surprise and discovery in those who see and use his products. He expects a person slipping for the first time into the Hollington executive chair, also available from Herman Miller for the Home, to say, ""Yes, of course, this is how a chair should feel."" 
Hollington studied design at the Royal College of Art in London in the early 1970s and shortly afterward ""discovered"" Herman Miller and the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames. ""If you asked me, way back, what`s the one company in the world I`d really like to work for, it would have been Herman Miller,"" he says. 
His hands come up to carve a rectangle out of the air as he describes the designer`s challenge of creating a humane environment for work. ""In the 1960s and 1970s, we tended to think of offices as factories or laboratories. We`re moving into a time when we think of offices as places where we can be creative."" 
It is this approach to design that makes his designs as appropriate for 
the home as for the office. 
Hollington`s desk is littered with used Edding 55 pens that no longer draw fine lines. He readily tosses copier paper into the bin. The paper, in fact, has commodity status, he says. No brand is perfect. Ideas are tried and rejected. It is the ritual.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller Work End Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","30"" Width x 22"" Depth x 29"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good- Vintage"

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Series Roll Up Tambour Desk1964 Design ~Features~Walnut Roll Up Top(4) Action DrawersEbonized Black Side PanelsDeep Inner File SpaceCast Aluminum FrameFoot RestWhite Laminate Writing Surface

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Vintage Conant Ball Russel Wright Dining Side Chairs

"Herman Miller Eames Soft Pad Series Management Chair","MR7846","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Charles and Ray Eames

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Herman Miller Eames Soft Pad Series Management Chair

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Russel Wright Dining Set

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames DCM Side Chair

"(1) Series 7 Side Chair Arne Jacobsen Reproduction","MR7388","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Arne Jacobsen
Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Series 7 Side Chair Arne Jacobsen","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 18"" x Depth 19"" x Height 30.25""

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Herman Miller Eames DCM Side Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Studio Brno Side Chair1920`s Design The Brno chair (model number MR50) is a modernist cantilever chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1929-1930 for the bedroom of the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. The design was based on similar chairs created by Mies van der Rohe working with Lilly Reich, such as the MR20 chair with wicker seat from 1927; all building on earlier designs of Mart Stam.The Brno chair has become a modern furniture Classic. It has very clean lines, consisting of a steel frame in a single piece, bent into a C-shape from the middle of the back, round past the front edge of seat (to create arms), and back under the seat to create a cantilever, with taut seat and back upholstered. There are two versions of the chair, one in tubular steel and the other in flat steel.

There was not one Long March, but several, as various Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. The most well known is the march from Jiangxi province which began in October 1934. The First Front Army of the Chinese Soviet Republic, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of complete annihilation by Chiang Kai-shek`s troops in their stronghold in Jiangxi province. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed some 12,500 kilometers (8,000 miles) over 370 days. The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to Shaanxi.The Long March began the ascent to power of Mao Zedong, whose leadership during the retreat gained him the support of the members of the party. The bitter struggles of the Long March, which was completed by only one-tenth of the force that left Jiangxi, would come to represent a significant episode in the history of the Communist Party of China, and would seal the personal prestige of Mao and his supporters as the new leaders of the party in the following decades.~3.5 Ft Original Propaganda Long March Mao China Also Available~","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","35.5"" Lenght/ Width x 24.75"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Poster> Very Good Original Vintage","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via DHL or BAX Global to your doorPrice is quoted by Destination, Quantity, Dimensions and Weight of your Purchase.

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Tobia Scarpa Andre Low Coffee Table

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Series Roll Up Tambour Desk","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","54"" Width/ Length x 30"" Depth x 46.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Original Vintage"
