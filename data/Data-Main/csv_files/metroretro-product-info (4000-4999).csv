Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Knoll Bertoia Full Cover for Side Chair Red vinyl original full cover stretches over the wire seat basket, tightly with draw-string and secured with hooks.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller. projects.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Set of Jens Risom Howe Desk, Credenza & Low Table

These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright.

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Auctioning a beautiful Dunbar Mahogany coffee table designed by Edward Wormley.

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 

The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 

Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick. Le Corbusier`s built oeuvre comprises about 60 buildings, and many would argue he was more gifted.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair (2) Le Corbusier","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Wide x 27"" Deep x 26"" High

Ernest Trova 

Ernest Trova`s father was an industrial designer, an influence that was ultimately to play a significant role in Trova`s art. Trova attended no art schools, teaching himself, learning intuitively. Referring to his rejection of academic training, he has said- ""Every kid draws but I became serious when I was about seventeen . . . Art study had nothing to do with it. I haven`t studied, and I don`t think it`s even necessary today. To paint a picture you don`t have to have anybody tell you what to do. There`s a combination of how people work. Half of it is instinct, and half of it is the thing you`ve acquired along the way, experience."" 
Trova was represented by Pace Gallery from 1963 to 1985 holding his first one man show in April 1963. Trova became one of the most sought-after sculptors of the 20th century breaking new ground with his ""Falling Man"" series.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","26"" H x 58"" L","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Holes in corners of board where previously hung.

David Rowland studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, as well as Eero Saarinen attended school. Early in his career, Rowland trained with both Lazlo Moholy-Nagy, the great Bauhaus emigre, and Norman Bel Geddes, the innovative American designer who streamlined industrial design and its production process. This unique combination of sophisticated European avant-garde modern design and American technical know-how allowed Rowland to create some of the most unique and comfortable seating produced. 

After opening his own office in 1954, David Rowland pursued numerous experiments in minimal seating with the goal of accomodating large numbers of people. These exercises culminated with the much lauded 40/4 Chair, designed in 1963 and was immediately awarded the grand prize at the prestigous Milan Triennale the next year. 

David Rowland went on to design numerous other chairs that satisfy the rigorous demands of mass production while retaining a high level of design sophistication, but the 40/4 chair has never been surpassed, by Rowland or others.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Rowland Stacking Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Bright Yellow Fiberglass Side Shell Chair

Founded in 1927 by Benjamin Lafer, a newly arrived immigrant, Lafer is today one of the most traditional furniture companies in Brazil. Since its very beginning, a strong image started to be forged by his tenacious will and commitment for quality and excellent customer service. An image which is still cultivated today, to the extreme. 

In 1961, already in its second generation, the company entered into furniture manufacturing. Creativity and technological innovation stood behind the series of remarkable products launched during this period, which caused great impact on the marketplace, for its advanced designs and affordable prices. 

Later on, Lafer diversified its activities, particularly on fiberglass products. As the most notorious examples of this period, the now legendary phone booths, which spread throughout Brazil in the 70`s, and the Lafer MP automobile, the remarkable little car that became a symbol of elegance and good taste for thousands of its owners, and a precious landmark for the company.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Brazilian Lafer Sofa

The world`s most singular, severely elegant collection of contemporary furniture has been created by Nicos Zographos. He has produced more than 300 kinds of products for thousands of spaces in America and Europe. Zographos is the last adherent to the strict aesthetic principles first defined by the European Bauhaus school, and he is very likely one of the last designers to manage his own manufacturing company. Within a business bounded by commercial constraints, his enduring values have significantly influenced both the style and the standards of the modern furniture industry. This piece carries the rounded corners, a recognizable Zographos element.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Classic Zographos Alpha Bench 

Originally designed for an architect friend, Tasso Katsealas, who had just designed his own home and wanted a piece to put in front of the fireplace, Zographos created a piece that became classic in its design. 

The rectangular pedestal merges with the lower legs and there is no break in the continuity, this was to give the bench a structural spine, that is something Zographos says he strived for in many of his pieces.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","72""L x 26.5""W x 15.5""H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Condition"

Warren McArthur (1885-1961), whose furniture helped define the glamour of 1930s Art Deco curves, grew up in an environment steeped in support for the advancements of the new age of technology and design. Raised in Chicago, his father was one of the first locals to own a car, and, in 1892, hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design their house. When McArthur moved to Arizona to form what would be a series of business ventures introducing modern aesthetics and philosophies to the Phoenix area, his father funded almost every project. With this support, both financial and inspirational, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Warren McArthur Folding Extending Table

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4ft Action Office Series Table Desk

Milo Baughman is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Armchairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Blue-Gray Fiberglass Side Shell Chair

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Bronze Barcelona Chair Frame

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune. In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller. projects.

Creating the Bold and Mischievous Style 
1889-1969 
Dorothy Draper, nee Dorothy Tuckerman, was born in 1889, in Tuxedo Park, New York, a center of long established old wealth. All of her life she told anyone who would listen that she simply “came from the right people”, a factor, which served her extremely well during the development of her very stylish Interior Decorating business, Dorothy Draper & Company. 
Dorothy’s decorating style reflected her own character. She was a woman with a wildly unique flair and a specifically individual point of view. Her unique trademarks were oversized architectural details, in mantle pieces and mouldings, partnered with upholstered pieces, sofas, chairs and loveseats, in chintz printed with enormous cabbage roses, executed in bold and almost shocking, for the period, colors. Dorothy successfully mixed greens and reds with coral, on floors, walls, and in carpet or chose jet black and dead white with shots of powerful colors as accents to make her decorating statements. Dorothy Draper sold her business in 1960. She died nine years later at the age of eighty. She had been on the covers of Time and Life magazines, and because of the publicity she sought and received, “DD” became a household name.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Warren Platner

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Chrome Bertoia Side Chair

Many influential decorators have worked in a signature style, but few contributed as many enduring influential furnishings to the design market as did Michael Taylor. His interiors appeared in every major magazine from the beginning of his career in the 1950`s to, quite literally, the end. Michael was the designer`s designer. His sense of scale was wonderment unequalled. He deplored the copyists - those who fed on his originality. 

Consistently denouncing the cluttered and pretentious, he had a simple ethos: when you take something out, you must increase the size of what`s left. The inventor of what has come to be known as the California Look, he became famous for white-walled, light-filled rooms with boldly over scaled furniture and decorative accessories. Taylor fans recognize his work to be pure and simple but by no means plain - a combination of rusticity and glamour. 

More than a decade after his death, Taylor`s reputation as an innovator in the world of home design glows undiminished. "" You can look at a picture of a room he designed in 1953, and it still looks wonderful today"", notes New York designer Albert Hadley. 

Paul J. Weaver, former Vice President of McGuire and an expert in marketing, collaborated with Taylor to set the cornerstone of a collection meticulously edited for today`s consumer at the top. Weaver, a highly visible spokesman for the company, has succeeded in identifying and further establishing the work upon which Taylor`s claim of importance and legacy are founded. ""In a market where the signature of an established tastemaker wields considerable influence"", says Weaver, ""Michael Taylor`s name speaks to the most discerning consumers in the market - the ones for whom the authority of quality, confidence, and style matter most"".

"Restored Pair Jens Risom Walnut Arm Chairs","MR4638","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Jens Risom Arm Chairs

Attruibute to Charles Rennie Mackintosh 

Charles Rennie Mackintosh was born one of eleven children in the Townhead area of Glasgow, close to Glasgow Cathedral. From these beginnings, he has become one of the most celebrated architects of his generation. 

He met Margaret Macdonald, his future wife, at Glasgow School of Art and much of what can be seen in the buildings and collections involves their artistic collaboration. You will also witness his masterful handling of light and space and see many of the well-known pieces of furniture which have themselves become icons. 

Mackintosh took his inspiration from our Scottish traditions and blended them with the flourish of Art Nouveau and the simplicity of Japanese forms. Much of his work has survived. It can be seen today alongside that of his close collaborators in the group known as ""The Four"" and the other artists and designers who collectively created ""The Glasgow Style"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","42"" W x 7"" D x 67.5"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend crate shipping via ForwardAir to the terminal nearest you.","","null"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Born in Milan in 1935, Mario Bellini graduated in architecture from the Milan Polytechnic in 1959, and set up practice as an architect in the early sixties. 
His work ranges from urban design and architecture to furnishing and industrial products. Renowned as designer, in 1963 he began his relationship with Olivetti in charge of industrial design, and went on to work with other companies both in Italy and abroad, amongst which Cassina. He won the Compasso d`Oro and other international awards more than once, and his work is exhibited in the MoMA collection in New York, which, in 1987, dedicated a personal retrospective exhibition to his work. Since the 80`s he has worked mainly in the field of architecture all over the world. His most well known work includes the Portello buildings for the Milan Fair, the conference centre of Villa Erba at Como, the extension of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and of the International Fair of Essen. From 1986 to 1991 he was director of the Domus magazine. In 1987, in continuing the work of his studio opened in the 60`s, he founded Mario Bellini Associates, of which he is the president, whose services run from masterplanning to architecture and the design of stands and sets for exhibitions and museums. In 1996 product and furniture design were transferred to the Bellini Atelier, which he founded with his son Claudio. 
A winning duo: a mix of independence and interaction. Two generations in one family exchange integrate and confront each other. A special relationship characterized by reciprocal autonomy and by a deep understanding when working on shared projects. A constructive family bond that generates a positive drive enhancing creative energies and managerial skills.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mario Bellini Tentazione 685 Armchair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","39.5"" Width x 33.5"" Depth x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good Vintage Condition"

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

Mark Rothko 

One of the preeminent artists of his generation, Mark Rothko is closely identified with the New York School, a circle of painters that emerged during the 1940s as a new collective voice in American art. During a career that spanned five decades, he created a new and impassioned form of abstract painting. Rothko`s work is characterized by rigorous attention to formal elements such as color, shape, balance, depth, composition, and scale; yet, he refused to consider his paintings solely in these terms.

"Edward Wormley Blonde Mahogany Dresser","MR4607","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Drexel","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design; he was one of those unique designers who were sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field’s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Restored Drexel Wormley Precedent Mahogany Dresser","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","39"" Width/Length x 19"" Depth x 32.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage>Refinished"

"George Nelson Herman Miller Walnut Credenza","MR4060","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Credenza","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","74.5"" Length/ Width x 18.75"" Depth x 27"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Wood> Excellent refinished"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Eames Yellow Fiberglass Armchair with Your Choice of Base

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Aalto 80B Table

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson

Pascal Mourgue had been a wood sculpture student at L’Ecole Boulle and pursued his interest in design and interior architecture at L’Ecole Nationale des Artes Decoratifs in his native France. In 1985, he developed the Pascal table system of conference tables, designed to be easily and attractively combined and interchanged to suit new commercial needs, especially those of the emerging home office. Lauded for his modern yet timeless style, Pascal Mourgue’s product designs for both home and office illustrate his belief that utility and fine art are not mutually exclusive.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Molded Fiberglass Shell Chair

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Breuer Side Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.5""W x 23.5""D x 31.5""H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good Condition"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Early Edition Eames

He has produced more than 300 kinds of products for thousands of spaces in America and Europe. Zographos is the last adherent to the strict aesthetic principles first defined by the European Bauhaus school, and he is very likely one of the last designers to manage his own manufacturing company.

He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Vintage Platner Lounge Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","36.5""W x 25.5""D x 30.25""HSeat Height- 18.5""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","-Very Good Vintage Condition -"

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Blue Bertoia Side Chair Cushion

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","7Ft Round Rosewood Laminate Conference Dining Table

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. In 1949 a later line called Modernmates/American Modern was produced offering eight various birch finishes designed by Russel Wright
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

Ettore Sottsass one of the most respected designers of 20th century Italian design. He was one of the founders of the Memphis Group collective, which was a group of recently graduated designers who created unusual objects and functional designs that were limited in production, they also were very revolutionary with their attempts to break barriers. He began his career by studying architecture at the Turin Polytechnic; he was a student from 1935 to 1939. After fighting in World War II, he opened up his own Milan based office in 1947, which he called The Studio. He worked as artistic director of ""Poltronova"", he worked at George Nelson, and as an industrial designer at ""Olivetti"" in which he received the coveted Compasso d`Oro for the design of the mainframe computer `Elea 9003.` He had much versatility and was able to work with a variety of materials.
