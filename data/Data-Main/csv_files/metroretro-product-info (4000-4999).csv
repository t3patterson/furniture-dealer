Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","1970`s Ward Bennett Channel-Back Lounge Chair  Upholstery> Dark Blue Leather Base> Wooden Posts These Lounge Chairs Were Taken From the Houston Enron Office

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer.
 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.

In 1949 a later line called Modernmates/American Modern was produced offering eight various birch finishes designed by Russel Wright.

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL SIDE CHAIR

"Herman Miller Table Desk - Designed by George Nelson","MR5793","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Length 47.75""

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

"sold Vintage Modern Robsjohn Gibbings Table & 6 Chairs","MR5061","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art DÃ©co style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dinette Table and Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Table: without leaves- L62x D48x H29.5           with leaves- L93.25x W40x H29.5Chairs: W17x D21x H33  S.H. 18","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend Blanket Wrap Shipping

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Mid Century Dining Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","42.5"" Diameter x 29"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Eero Saarinen was the son of the celebrated Finnish architect and first President of the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Eliel Saarinen. Born in Helsinki, he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1923. Initially studied sculpture at the Académie de la Grande Chaumiére in Paris (1929/30) and later architecture at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, graduating in 1934. He received a scholarship there which enabled him to travel to Europe (1934/35). On his return, he taught at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. In 1937, he began a collaboration with Charles Eames which culminated in a series of highly progressive and prize-winning furniture designs for The Museum of Modern Art´s 1940 ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings"" competition. He later produced several highly successful furniture designs for Knoll International. He worked in his father´s architectural office until Eliel´s death in 1950.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Breuer Bryn Mawr Desk

Desk was conceived in 1937 when Breuer received his first American commission with Bryn Mawr College. 
The design was a continuation of the work he had been pursuing in Europe, most notably with Isokon Furniture in England. 
The pioneering use of plywood in the construction of these modern classics influenced the fledgling group of American designers who carried the technique further after the War.

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where Aino Marsio joined him after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood.

Alexander Henry McIntosh, a boyhood friend of Andrew Carnegie, opened up his furniture business at the foot of Whytescauseway in 1869. The business prospered and larger premises were required.

The firm is now known as ESA McIntosh.McIntosh furniture was very elaborate. The firm exhibited work at the Paris Furniture Exhibition in 1879 and at the Sydney Exhibition in Australia in 1880.The factory also produced marquetry panels and these along with furniture produced in the Victoria Road factory were fitted on the famous ship Queen Mary launched in 1934 by Queen Mary.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Seats Original Vintage Upholstery","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Table>48"" L x 48"" W x 29"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Mint Vintage Condition"

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. Herman Miller recently acquired the company","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24 .5"" Width x 22"" Depth x 30.75 Height Wide Seat Width

He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Alvar Aalto Square Birch Table

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. In 1949 a later line called Modernmates/American Modern was produced offering eight various birch finishes designed by Russel Wright
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

"24"" x 18"" Peter Ruting Framed Giclee Print-Stone","MR5751","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Peter Ruting 

Peter Ruting was born in Amsterdam on the 5th of November, 1938. There he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts, nowadays called ""the Rietveld Academy"", and after his graduation in 1960 he worked as a freelance photographer. In 1968 he branched out and opened a studio in Amsterdam. All sorts of people found their way to him, bringing in a wide range of commissions. Advertising agencies, companies, and other organizations called on him, to photograph projects of increasing scale. Amongst the largest commissions where campaigns for banks, breweries, and the dairy industry. 

In the meantime, Peter Ruting felt a growing need to spend time on his own work. During the seventies, he decreased his commercial commitments, and concentrated more and more on his personal work. 
Around 1980 the balance shifted markedly in favor of the exploration of his own photography. Though the ground work had been ready for some time, the shift was a slow process. In 1983 Peter Ruting made his debut with results of his photographic explorations at the Canon Photo Gallery in Amsterdam. Since that day many exhibitions of his work have followed, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Though far less than in the past, Peter still takes on commissions, producing photography for annual reports, calendars, and business to business promotion.

The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance. The use of fire to produce burnt lime, which was also used for the hafting of implements thus predates the use of pottery by almost a thousand years. In the early Neolithic settlement of Cayönü in eastern Turkey ca. 90 m² of terrazzo floors have been uncovered. The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevali Cori measure about 80 m². They are 15 cm thick, and contain about 10-15 % lime.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","58"" Diameter X 29"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom Design

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) George Nelson for Herman Miller Lounge Arm Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.5"" Width x 24"" Depth x 30"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair (2) Scissor Lounge Chairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eames molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. Charles and Ray Eames continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

"Herman Miller G. Nelson Light Office Chair","MR5783","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Nelson Light Office Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","26"" Length X 24"" Wide X 35"" Deep with a seat height of 18""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good"

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Lounge Chair

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum

"Jens Risom Walnut Two Tiered Coffee Table Tapered Legs","MR5164","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom Solid Walnut Two Tier Coffee Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Table Top > 32"" L x 32"" W x 21""H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent> Refinished","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via BAX Global for $150.

When McArthur moved to Arizona to form what would be a series of business ventures introducing modern aesthetics and philosophies to the Phoenix area, his father funded almost every project.

"24"" x 18"" Peter Ruting Framed Giclee Print-Pebble","MR5750","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Peter Ruting 

Peter Ruting was born in Amsterdam on the 5th of November, 1938. There he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts, nowadays called ""the Rietveld Academy"", and after his graduation in 1960 he worked as a freelance photographer. In 1968 he branched out and opened a studio in Amsterdam. All sorts of people found their way to him, bringing in a wide range of commissions. Advertising agencies, companies, and other organizations called on him, to photograph projects of increasing scale. Amongst the largest commissions where campaigns for banks, breweries, and the dairy industry. 

In the meantime, Peter Ruting felt a growing need to spend time on his own work. During the seventies, he decreased his commercial commitments, and concentrated more and more on his personal work. 
Around 1980 the balance shifted markedly in favor of the exploration of his own photography. Though the ground work had been ready for some time, the shift was a slow process. In 1983 Peter Ruting made his debut with results of his photographic explorations at the Canon Photo Gallery in Amsterdam. Since that day many exhibitions of his work have followed, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Though far less than in the past, Peter still takes on commissions, producing photography for annual reports, calendars, and business to business promotion.

These plexiglas lamps from the 1940s and ‘50s were made to be bizzare and original. Produced by San Francisco’s Moss Manufacturing Company, the lamps were made as a responce to metal rationing during world war II. Company owner Gerry Moss turned to staff designer Duke Smith who turned to a new material--plexiglas. Developed in 1934, plexi had a number of points in its favor: it was inexpensive, it was novel, and perhaps, most importantly, it wasn’t rationed.  This little number sports a fine red shade that sits a bit on the dangerous side. There aren`t many things that say retro like a Moss lamp. They have become popular recently among Hollywood actors, musicians, and celebrities.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Lamp: W11.5x D6.25x H25","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via DHL for $60"

"(6) Jens Risom Scandinavian Walnut Side Chairs","MR5174","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom Scandinavian Design Side Chairs (6)","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" W x 23"" D x 31.5"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via DHL orForwardAir to the terminal nearest you.

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MR 10 Side Chairs 

1927 Design 

Throughout the 1920s the German architect Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969) collaborated with the interior designer Lilly Reich (1885-1947) on the development of furniture for his architectural projects. By the mid-1920s they, like other progressive designers, were fascinated by the possibilities of tubular metal. Mies and Reich were intrigued by the cantilever chair, which they saw as the acme of modernity offering the comfort of a conventional armchair without the bourgeois associations of upholstery. By 1927, they had developed the textile-seated MR10 and cane-seated MR20. Both chairs were exhibited at the 1927 Die Wohnung exhibition of modern living at the Weissenhof Settlement in Stuttgart.

David Rowland studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, where Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, as well as Eero Saarinen attended school. Early in his career, Rowland trained with both Lazlo Moholy-Nagy, the great Bauhaus emigre, and Norman Bel Geddes, the innovative American designer who streamlined industrial design and its production process. This unique combination of sophisticated European avant-garde modern design and American technical know-how allowed Rowland to create some of the most unique and comfortable seating produced. 
After opening his own office in 1954, David Rowland pursued numerous experiments in minimal seating with the goal of accomodating large numbers of people. These exercises culminated with the much-lauded 40/4 Chair, designed in 1963 and were immediately awarded the grand prize at the prestigous Milan Triennale the next year. 
David Rowland went on to design numerous other chairs that satisfy the rigorous demands of mass production while retaining a high level of design sophistication, but Rowland or others have never surpassed the 40/4 chair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Rowland Stacking Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","20"" Width x 18"" Depth x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Condition-Refinished

"24"" x 18"" Peter Ruting Framed Giclee Print-Beyond","MR5752","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Peter Ruting 

Peter Ruting was born in Amsterdam on the 5th of November, 1938. There he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts, nowadays called ""the Rietveld Academy"", and after his graduation in 1960 he worked as a freelance photographer. In 1968 he branched out and opened a studio in Amsterdam. All sorts of people found their way to him, bringing in a wide range of commissions. Advertising agencies, companies, and other organizations called on him, to photograph projects of increasing scale. Amongst the largest commissions where campaigns for banks, breweries, and the dairy industry. 

In the meantime, Peter Ruting felt a growing need to spend time on his own work. During the seventies, he decreased his commercial commitments, and concentrated more and more on his personal work. 
Around 1980 the balance shifted markedly in favor of the exploration of his own photography. Though the ground work had been ready for some time, the shift was a slow process. In 1983 Peter Ruting made his debut with results of his photographic explorations at the Canon Photo Gallery in Amsterdam. Since that day many exhibitions of his work have followed, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Though far less than in the past, Peter still takes on commissions, producing photography for annual reports, calendars, and business to business promotion.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Peter Ruting Giclee Print

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Breuer Bryn Mawr Dresser

Commissioned for the Rhoads Dormitory at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania 

Desk was conceived in 1937 when Breuer received his first American commission with Bryn Mawr College. 
The design was a continuation of the work he had been pursuing in Europe, most notably with Isokon Furniture in England. 
The pioneering use of plywood in the construction of these modern classics influenced the fledgling group of American designers who carried the technique further after the War.

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. In 1949 a later line called Modernmates/American Modern was produced offering eight various birch finishes designed by Russel Wright
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

"Globe Wernicke File Cabinet Mid Century SOLD","MR5497","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Globe-Wernicke

Otto Heinrich Louis Wernicke in 1889 invented a stacking system for units, meant as a quick system of building up storage shelves. The design of this storage rack - made from bare planks - formed the basis of the later known Globe-Wernicke bookcase technique. 

The first patent for this shelving system was granted in 1892 and not long after the Wernicke Company, in Norwood, a suburb of Cincinnati in the USA, emerged. The popularity of the then known Wernicke bookcase units rose very quickly. With frequent advertising in the North Western Law Reporter these units were soon given the nickname the Barrister Bookcases. But notaries, lawyers and ministers also found the stacking bookcase system an attractive benefit. 

In 1899 the company Globe took over the Wernicke Company. The Globe Company had already proved itself as the largest producers of archive systems, filing cabinets and pigeonhole shelving. Thanks to the increasing popularity of the units they could start refining them. Thus they began using them to hang in window fronts, which helped prevent dust. As a result of this, the Globe-Wernicke bookshelf system developed a wider market.","","null","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Four Drawer File Cabinet","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width15x Depth27.5x Height53","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.for more information on Jens Risom> http://www.russelwrightcenter.org/risom.html","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Early Edition Jens Risom Coffee  & Side TablesJens Risom Coffee Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Coffee Table> 48"" L x 24"" W x 16"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good"

"Vintage Modern Dunbar Wormley Swivel Vanity Stool","MR5046","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Dunbar","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dunbar Swivel Vanity Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

One of the unique features of this aluminum group chair is the way in which the seat pad is held in place and stretched tautly around cylinders at either end of the chair frame, creating a “sitting pocket” that is both firm and flexible.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 26"" Depth x 34"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

"24"" x 18"" Peter Ruting Framed Giclee Print-Wheel","MR5748","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Peter Ruting 

Peter Ruting was born in Amsterdam on the 5th of November, 1938. There he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts, nowadays called ""the Rietveld Academy"", and after his graduation in 1960 he worked as a freelance photographer. In 1968 he branched out and opened a studio in Amsterdam. All sorts of people found their way to him, bringing in a wide range of commissions. Advertising agencies, companies, and other organizations called on him, to photograph projects of increasing scale. Amongst the largest commissions where campaigns for banks, breweries, and the dairy industry. 

In the meantime, Peter Ruting felt a growing need to spend time on his own work. During the seventies, he decreased his commercial commitments, and concentrated more and more on his personal work. 
Around 1980 the balance shifted markedly in favor of the exploration of his own photography. Though the ground work had been ready for some time, the shift was a slow process. In 1983 Peter Ruting made his debut with results of his photographic explorations at the Canon Photo Gallery in Amsterdam. Since that day many exhibitions of his work have followed, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Though far less than in the past, Peter still takes on commissions, producing photography for annual reports, calendars, and business to business promotion.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame.

Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles.

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. In 1949 a later line called Modernmates/American Modern was produced offering eight various birch finishes designed by Russel Wright

"24"" x 18"" Peter Ruting Framed Giclee Print-River","MR5754","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Peter Ruting 

Peter Ruting was born in Amsterdam on the 5th of November, 1938. There he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts, nowadays called ""the Rietveld Academy"", and after his graduation in 1960 he worked as a freelance photographer. In 1968 he branched out and opened a studio in Amsterdam. All sorts of people found their way to him, bringing in a wide range of commissions. Advertising agencies, companies, and other organizations called on him, to photograph projects of increasing scale. Amongst the largest commissions where campaigns for banks, breweries, and the dairy industry. 

In the meantime, Peter Ruting felt a growing need to spend time on his own work. During the seventies, he decreased his commercial commitments, and concentrated more and more on his personal work. 
Around 1980 the balance shifted markedly in favor of the exploration of his own photography. Though the ground work had been ready for some time, the shift was a slow process. In 1983 Peter Ruting made his debut with results of his photographic explorations at the Canon Photo Gallery in Amsterdam. Since that day many exhibitions of his work have followed, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Though far less than in the past, Peter still takes on commissions, producing photography for annual reports, calendars, and business to business promotion.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Peter Ruting Giclee Print

Marcel Breuer was one of the most famous architects and designers of the 20th century. He was a pioneer in the use of tubular steel in furniture design. This chair, created in 1926 at the Bauhaus, marked the first time that steel tubing was used in the mass production of furniture.

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Aalto 80B Table

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Wire Coffee Table

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ward Bennett Enron Carved Office ChairUpholstery> Light Brown LeatherFrame> Solid Black Wood  These Office ChairsCame From The 49th and 50th Floors of 1400 Smith Street, ENRON`s Corporate Headquarters, where the offices of the Corporate Executives included the CEO, COO and CFO This Ad is for 1 Chair5 Chairs are Available","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 24"" Depth x 32"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Vintage"

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

"Stangl Terra Rose Goat Vase Excellent Condition","MR5038","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Stangl 

Stangl Pottery traces its history back to the Fulper Pottery of New Jersey. In 1910, Johann Martin Stangl started working at Fulper. He left to work at Haeger Pottery from 1915 to 1920. Stangl returned to Fulper Pottery in 1920, became president in 1926, and changed the company name to Stangl Pottery in 1929. Stangl acquired the firm in 1930. The pottery is known for dinnerware and a line of bird figurines. Martin Stangl died in 1972 and the pottery was sold to Frank Wheaton, Jr., of Wheaton Industries. Production continued until 1978, when Pfaltzgraff Pottery purchased the right to the Stangl trademark and the remaining inventory was liquidated. A single bird figurine is identified by a number. Figurines made up of two birds are identified by a number followed by the letter D indicating “Double.”","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stangl Goat Vase

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair (2) Vintage Jens Risom Knoll","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 23"" Depth x 32.5"" Height

After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Paul Frankl Cork Side TablesTable Top> Pressed CorkLegs> Solid Wood with Bronze Caps Identical tables can be seen on 1st dibs.com for $4,400","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18"" Length x 18"" Width x 16"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Vintage Condition","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via DHL $35 Per TableQUOTED FOR U.S. ONLY"

At Princeton the chairs were used for faculty seating, and remained evident well after World War II.

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Sofa & Lounge Chair Set

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ward Bennett Armchair

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Custom Made Cedar Screen 

In 1939, Alvar Aalto designed a huge curvilinear wood screen for the Finnish Pavilion at the New York Worlds Fair. The screen dramatically established Aalto`s genius and his fluency with wood, a ""warm and supple"" material that he felt softened the austerity of European modernism. We offer a smaller, domestic version of the ""wavy wall"" screen that can effectively divide space where desired.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Ward Bennett Channel-Back Lounge Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","31.5"" Width x 27.5"" Depth x 31.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Orange Fiberglass Side Shell Chair

Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Thayer Coggin Sofa

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Credenza","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","null","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Near Excellent

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office.

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Thayer Coggin Arm Chairs

"Ward Bennett Mid Century Vintage Leather Club Chairs","MR5289","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Vintage Ward Bennett Club Swivel ChairsUpholstery> Original Tuft Rust LeatherBase> Swivel WoodThis Ad is for 2 Rust Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","28"" Width x 28"" Depth x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 
In 1949 a later line called Modernmates/American Modern was produced offering eight various birch finishes designed by Russel Wright
A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","MODERNMATES BY CONANT BALL BUFFET #2933","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","44"" Length x 15"" Width x 30"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Bruno Mathsson descended from four generations of cabinetmakers in Värnamo, Sweden. A perfectionist to the core, he did not consider a piece of furniture complete unless it could pass inspection turned upside down. The designer experimented with carving, bending, laminating, and finishing different types of wooden frameworks and fashioning them with innovative webbings made of hemp, linen or other fabric. Mathsson would make a chair or chaise lounge, and continue to create variations and refine the piece until he was satisfied it was both pleasing to the eye and the rest of the body. Each work of art was custom-made in his family’s shop in Värnamo and signed by Mathsson who associated his own Modern furniture with the traditional handicraft of his ancestors. 
Mathsson was an architect as well. He designed the Småland Art Archive in Värnamo and from 1947 – 1957 experimented with incorporating large areas of glass into local residential architecture. Although his experiments were not well received in the cold, conservative northern province where he worked, he completed over 100 architectural projects. But it was in the arena of furniture design that he had the most far-reaching impact. While his specialty was seating, he also created influential table designs. 

In 1959 poet and mathematician Piet Hein developed the superellipse (expressed mathematically as xn/an + yn/bn = 1) to address an urban design problem in Stockholm. Mathsson seized upon the superellipse as an elegant formal solution applicable to a smaller-scale problem—the tabletop. He designed the self-clamping leg for a superellipse table made in collaboration with Hein. The V-shaped metal leg can be inserted without tools and anchored to the floor. The self-clamping leg has a direct descendant in contemporary Danish designer Erik Magnussen’s Click series.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mathsson Folding Table

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","22"" Width x 24"" Depth x 31.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent> Reupholstered"

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair (2) Vintage Jens Risom Knoll","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 23"" Depth x 31.5"" Height

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes.

Jack Kelley sails the Great Lakes the same way he cruises cyberspace--fast and with agility. He`s as skillful on deck as he is on line. 
""The thrill of sailing is that it puts you in communion with natural forces,"" says the erstwhile divisional winner of the Queen`s Cup and othertrans-Lake Michigan races. ""And the thrill of computers is that they put you in control of tremendous amounts of information."" 
Kelley uses his knowledge of computers as a driving force behind many of his furniture designs. 
""You have to understand computers--and the people who depend of them--to design for today`s offices,"" he says. 
Kelley does more than stay abreast of the latest technological developments. He gets out into the real work world, meeting face-to-face with the people whose lives he`s trying to make better--and more healthful. 
Kelley has been captivated by computers since 1969, when he worked at the Stanford Research Institute with Douglas Engelbart, inventor of the world`s first computer mouse. The mouse needed a pad, so Kelley designed it--the world`s first mouse pad, an invention that brought him great satisfaction and an early understanding of the complexities of working in computer environments. 
He did that work as a researcher/designer for the Herman Miller Research Corporation, headed at that time by Robert Propst, inventor of another world`s first: the Action Office system. Kelley worked side-by-side with Propst throughout the 60s and early 70s and played a pivotal role in the design of many Action Office components. 
During that time he also took up sailing, an avocation that dovetails nicely with his industrial design career. Both demand strict attention to detail, an understanding of obstacles, and a passion to overcome them. 
""I won`t tolerate anything that doesn`t work on a sailboat,"" he asserts, ""so why would I tolerate anything that doesn`t work in the office?"" 
Kelley continues to turn that intolerance into functional and attractive products. 
After more than 40 years of designing for Herman Miller, at an age when many feel awash in the tidal wave of technological advance, Jack Kelley is riding its crest.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Scooter Keyboard Stand

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Ward Bennett Armchairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","10 Ft Herman Miller Eames Walnut Dining Conference Table

When McArthur moved to Arizona to form what would be a series of business ventures introducing modern aesthetics and philosophies to the Phoenix area, his father funded almost every project. With this support, both financial and inspirational, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Warren McArthur folding chairs This classic chair has a tubular anodized aluminum frame.

1983 - 1986 

Long, medium & FM wavebands were featured on this high-technology 2 x 55 watts receiver that served as the heart of Beosystem 5000 introduced in 1983. 

A frequency-synthesized tuner with automatic fine tuning & two-speed manual drive all contributed to fast, accurate location of radio programmes & superb reception quality. 
Nine station frequencies (on any combination of wavebands) could be stored in the Beomaster`s microcomputer memory for instant recall. 

The low-distortion stereo amplifier includes a very advanced feature, unique to Bang & Olufsen: Automatic Power Handling Control. 
This circuit continuously monitored the dynamic range & power of the signal & instructed the microcomputer to decrease volume if the combined effects of these two parameters threatened to cause amplifier ""clipping"" or damage to the speakers. 

An internal, variable-speed fan ensured the proper dissipation of heat, even when the Beomaster was used in a stack format. 

Connections: 2 cassette decks (one with A/B monitoring); record deck; Aux/CD player; graphic equaliser; Aux power amplifier socket had built-in pre-amp. All sockets duplicated in DIN and RCA types. 2 pairs speakers. Stereo headphones. Data-link connections to associated Bang & Olufsen sound sources. AM & FM aerials.

"4ft Herman Miller Table Desk Designed by George Nelson","MR5794","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Table Desk

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Wire Side Occassional Table

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Ward Bennett Armchairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","21.5""W x 25""D x 34.5""H

"Mid-Century Wood Daybed Bench Osvaldo Borsani","MR5034","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Osvaldo Borsani 
In 1937, Osvaldo entered the Politecnico di Milano to study architecture. After completing his degree, he joined the family business, Atelier Varedo (later Arredamento Borsani) as a furniture designer. Throughout the 1940s and early 50s, Osvaldo produced a large body of work including case goods, storage pieces and seating. Especially noteworthy was a 1946 wall-mounted shelving system. Among his clients were Crippa, Fabbri, Fontana and Sussu. 

In 1953, Osvaldo and Fulgencio founded a firm called Tecno which, as its name suggests, became known for its technology- and research-based approach to furniture design. In 1955, Tenco issued one of its best-known pieces, the P40 chaise longue. Described as a ""machine for sitting"", it featured rubber arms and could assume 486 distinct postures; the D70, a sofa version, was also manufactured. 

Osvaldo himself acted as the company`s sole designer for over 30 years; it was not until the mid 1980s that Gae Aulenti, Norman Foster and others began to contribute designs. Today, Tecno is known for its innovative furniture for offices and public buildings. 

Osvaldo had a long history of participation in the Triennale di Milano dating back to 1933, when he collaborated with architects Cairoli and G. B. Varisco on a project called the ""Casa Minima""; he would continue to exhibit his work there for decades to come. His designs were showcased by museums and galleries throughout Europe and, in 1962, he received the prestigious Premio Compasso d’Oro","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid-Century Wood Daybed Bench","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","90"" L x 32"" W x 34"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via Blanket Wrap Shipping for $485"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Breuer Arm Chair

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) George Nelson Maple Wood Orange Suede Lounge Arm Chairs Midcentury Modern American 1948 Features: Professionally Reupholstered Rust SuedeMaple Wood Frame and Legs Ornamental Button Tack Detail  This Ad is for the Pair!!","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.5"" Width x 24"" Depth x 30"" HeightSeat Height> 16.5""Arm Height> 24""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good-Reupholstered"

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Alvar Aalto  ICF 406W Pension Armchair  Introduced in 1938-39 These Popular Armchairs have a Laminated Cantilevered Birch Frame with Solid Birch Cross-Rails and The Back is Shaped to Provide a Slight Recline It’s Lightweight, Easy to Maneuver, Strong, Durable and Comfortable SeatingThe Webbed Suspension is Made of Linen  This Ad is for 1 Armchair (shipping is for 1 armchair)2 Armchairs Are Available Alvar Aalto Square Birch Tables to MatchAlvar Aalto Chaise Lounge to Match","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23"" Width x 25""Depth x 34"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O’Hare Airports.

"Pair (2) Vintage Retro Mid Century Moss Table Lamp","MR5345","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Moss LampA Moss lamp is hard to forget. These plexiglas lamps from the 1940s and ‘50s were made to be bizzare and original. Produced by San Francisco’s Moss Manufacturing Company, the lamps were made as a responce to metal rationing during world war II. Company owner Gerry Moss turned to staff designer Duke Smith who turned to a new material--plexiglas. Developed in 1934, plexi had a number of points in its favor: it was inexpensive, it was novel, and perhaps, most importantly, it wasn’t rationed.  This retro lamp is the epitome of 50`s verve and fun. The scribbling pattern on the paper sides of this lamp is reminiscent of the art of Cy Twombly and the whole effect of this piece is one of art and fifties whimsy.  The top light works and the lamp base has a florescent light inside it that needs to be replaced (Sylvania f8t5/cw U.S.A.). This is a set of TWO lamps.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","W9x D12x H26","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","Flat Rate shipping","","null"

"24"" x 18"" Peter Ruting Framed Giclee Print-Lines","MR5753","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Peter Ruting 

Peter Ruting was born in Amsterdam on the 5th of November, 1938. There he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts, nowadays called ""the Rietveld Academy"", and after his graduation in 1960 he worked as a freelance photographer. In 1968 he branched out and opened a studio in Amsterdam. All sorts of people found their way to him, bringing in a wide range of commissions. Advertising agencies, companies, and other organizations called on him, to photograph projects of increasing scale. Amongst the largest commissions where campaigns for banks, breweries, and the dairy industry. 

In the meantime, Peter Ruting felt a growing need to spend time on his own work. During the seventies, he decreased his commercial commitments, and concentrated more and more on his personal work. 
Around 1980 the balance shifted markedly in favor of the exploration of his own photography. Though the ground work had been ready for some time, the shift was a slow process. In 1983 Peter Ruting made his debut with results of his photographic explorations at the Canon Photo Gallery in Amsterdam. Since that day many exhibitions of his work have followed, both in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Though far less than in the past, Peter still takes on commissions, producing photography for annual reports, calendars, and business to business promotion.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Bennett Side ChairsEnron Corporation was an American energy company based in Houston, Texas. Before its bankruptcy in late 2001, Enron employed around 21,000 people (McLean & Elkind, 2003) and was one of the world`s leading electricity, natural gas, pulp and paper, and communications companies, with claimed revenues of $111 billion in 2000. Fortune named Enron ""America`s Most Innovative Company"" for six consecutive years. It achieved infamy at the end of 2001, when it was revealed that its reported financial condition was sustained mostly by institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud.The planning and execution of this fraud, and the subsequent ruin of many of Enron`s employees, took place in the Enron executive offices on 1400 Smith Street, Houston Texas.  In this building, high on the 50th floor, prominant senior executives, planned and worked amidst pieces of designer furniture.

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition International des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen’s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine’s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen’s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 18"" x Depth 19"" x Height 30.25""

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copenhagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, and easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. Dictaphone acquired the studio in 1970 and in 1973; Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom Retro Walnut Leg Swivel Lounge Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","29” Width x 27.5” Depth x 40” HeightSeat Height>18”","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

"sold Pair (2)Vintage Jens Risom Knoll Side Chairs","MR5942","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Knoll","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens RisomJens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair (2)Vintage Jens Risom Knoll Side Chairs These Fashionable 50`s Design Side Chairs Features A Sleek Walnut Frame Accented by a Turquoise Vinyl Seat And Back","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 23"" Depth x 31.5"" Height

An early printed reference to the chair occurs in an 1890 New York Times article describing the furnishings of a Pullman parlor car. By the turn of the century, Bank of England seats and arms were mounted on swivel bases with casters and were some of the most fashionable desk chairs. The Bank of England chair was associated not only with financial institutions but with courts and other formal places; Yale Law School ordered many at the turn of the century. At Princeton the chairs were used for faculty seating, and remained evident well after World War II. A few turn up today in lecture halls and public rooms, but by the early 20th century, lecture halls in new buildings had built-in oak seats with writing arms. The Bank of England chair remains one of the best seats for preceptors and seminars tough but comfortably contoured.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 23"" Depth 31"" HeightSeat Height 18""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good VintageCan be refinished for an additional $100 upon request","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend shipping via BAX Global for $80
