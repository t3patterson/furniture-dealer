The back is free-standing and can be placed precisely where people think it should be so it gives the best comfort. 
Strength and control in any position. 

Control is particularly about the loose back snake not shifting when you lean back. 

The secret behind the stability of the back is simple math, which ensures that the triangle’s central force lies in one line that is not too reclining. It is a question of finding the angle where the back does not tip over,” elaborates Jens Juul Eilesen. 

This sectional has the flexibility to be arrange in different ways.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Herman Miller Small Single Drawer

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(10) Herman Miller Eames DCM Side Chair Upholstered","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","20"" Width x 20"" Depth x 30.5"" HeightSeat Height 19","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

McCobb, like his contemporaries Harvey Probber and George Nelson, helped introduce Americans to modular furniture. McCobb, who never received any formal design training, first established a studio in 1945. He worked primarily as a decorator and retail display designer, eventually turning his attention to furniture: by 1950, B.G. Mosberg was marketing his stylish, affordable Planner Group. Other, more luxurious collections followed, including the Directional, Predictor Linear, and Perimeter lines, all produced by Winchendon Furniture and marketed by McCobb himself. McCobb`s pieces were flexible and practical, designed to meet the needs of post World War II middle-class lifestyles. For example, his ""living walls"", complete with moveable room dividers and storage systems, allowed for maximum efficiency in limited spaces. He became a household name in the 1950`s, earning himself the nickname ""America`s Decorator"". His work was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.

"Enron Ward Bennett Bankers Arm Chair and Sofa Couch","MR6312","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Brickel","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett
Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","5 Leg Table Desk Laminated Top by Jens Risom","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","90"" Length x 42""Width x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Fritz Hansen Arne Jacobsen Dining Table & (6) American Desk Corporation Gideon Kramer Ion Chairs Table FeaturesWhite Laminate Top TablePolished Aluminum Base Chairs Featurescirca 1960-1969

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Molded Fiberglass Side Shell Chair

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Warren Platner Coffee Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Diameter 16"" x Height 18""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent"

"Vintage Ebonized Dorothy Draper Style Dresser","MR6355","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","In The Style OfDorothy Draper 
Creating the Bold and Mischievous Style 
1889-1969 
Dorothy Draper, nee Dorothy Tuckerman, was born in 1889, in Tuxedo Park, New York, a center of long established old wealth. All of her life she told anyone who would listen that she simply “came from the right people”, a factor, which served her extremely well during the development of her very stylish Interior Decorating business, Dorothy Draper & Company. 
Dorothy’s decorating style reflected her own character. She was a woman with a wildly unique flair and a specifically individual point of view. Her unique trademarks were oversized architectural details, in mantle pieces and mouldings, partnered with upholstered pieces, sofas, chairs and loveseats, in chintz printed with enormous cabbage roses, executed in bold and almost shocking, for the period, colors. Dorothy successfully mixed greens and reds with coral, on floors, walls, and in carpet or chose jet black and dead white with shots of powerful colors as accents to make her decorating statements. Dorothy Draper sold her business in 1960. She died nine years later at the age of eighty. She had been on the covers of Time and Life magazines, and because of the publicity she sought and received, “DD” became a household name. The style that she created and so successfully executed is still influential today","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dorothy Draper Style Dresser  Ebonized Finish With Gold InlayThree Drawers With Round Metal Handle Pulls This Ad is for 1 Dresser(missing 1 handle Pull)","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","30"" Width x 16"" Depth x 31"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","We recommend crate shipping via ForwardAir to the terminal nearest you

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Conant Ball Russel Wright Maple Night Stand Table

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work.
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts.
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Knoll Wassily Marcel Breuer Leather","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","31"" Width x 28"" Depth x 28"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","8 ft.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum

(1914-1999) 
Finnish designer developed a unique aesthetic based on the remarkably international education he received from several of the masters of the mid-century style. While running his office in Helsinki, Tapiovaara went abroad to work for Alvar Aalto in Artek`s London office in 1935, for Le Corbusier in Paris in 1937 and for Mies van der Rohe in Chicago in 1953. Tapiovaara received his formal education in Finland as a student of industrial and interior design at the Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki, and combined this background with his exposure to the different components of western design movements to create his furniture and textiles. He wrote that, ""a designer can be compared with a surgeon. Once you know your trade, you can practice it anywhere. If your work is good, it will do everywhere.""

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mies van der Rohe Brno Classic Side Arm Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","22"" Width x 22"" Depth x 32"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Frame~Very Good Vintage"

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Armchairs Set

Raised in Chicago, his father was one of the first locals to own a car, and, in 1892, hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design their house. When McArthur moved to Arizona to form what would be a series of business ventures introducing modern aesthetics and philosophies to the Phoenix area, his father funded almost every project. With this support, both financial and inspirational, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Warren Mcarthur Folding Extending Table ~Features~Aluminum base connection to top portion.

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edward Wormley Precedent Side Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 19"" x Depth 20"" x Height 30.5""

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Sofa Couch Brickel by Ward Bennett

"Vintage Wormley Drexel Precedent Night Stand Table Wood HOLD","MR6295","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Drexel","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Drexel Precedent Night-Stand

Ernest Trova was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1927. An entirely self-taught artist, Trova works mostly in sculpture and silkscreen and has been classified as both a Surrealist and Pop artist. His early work was influenced by Pollock, Dubuffet and de Kooning. He is perhaps best known for his “Falling Man” series, in which he comments poignantly on the human condition with a series of silkscreens and sculptures depicting the rise and fall of man in a modern age of technology. The work gained Trova widespread recognition for his important contribution to the art world, with a study of humanity and the dilemma of man in our contemporary reality.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","""Series Seventy-Five""

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.

During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Series 7 designed in 1955 by Arne Jacobsen","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18"" Width x 15.5"" Depth x 31"" Height 15.5"" Seat Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

"Herman Miller Large Single Drawer Designed by Nelson","MR6339","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Herman Miller Large Single Drawer

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.

During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","null","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 18"" x Depth 19"" x Height 30.25""

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Knoll Bertoia Full Cushion and Black Diamond Chair

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

"(1) Knoll Style Bertoia Seat Cushion Red New- Reproduction Velcro Strap","MR6694","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Harry Bertoia

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Red Bertoia Side Chair Cushion

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","BIG SALE! 23% OFF ORIGINAL PRICE!!","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","45 1/2"" Length x 45 1/2"" Width x 15"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

"Herman Miller George Nelson Desk Double Drawer","MR6334","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Herman Miller Double Drawer

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Table Desk Laminated Top by Jens Risom  Jens Risom Desk  White Laminate Top  Solid Walnut Base1941 Scandinavian design  Risom’s tables display the same sturdy, straightforward construction that represents his distinctive style  This Ad is per table we have 3 available Also some other Jens Risom tables avilable","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","60"" Length x 35.5""Width x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

 Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O’Hare Airports.

"Sold Pair Of Vintage Mid Century Modern Velvet Lounge Chairs","MR6483","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Based in the Manner of George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Club Chair.

(1902-1981)
Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work.
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts.
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Studio Marcel Breuer Laccio Tables Black","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Small low table dimensions are 21 ¾"" Width/Length x 19"" Depth x 17 ¾"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

"(1) Antique J & J Kohn Vienna Austria Chair","MR6653","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","J & J KOHNAustriaJacob Kohn went into partnership with his son Josef (1814-1884) in 1867. J&J Kohn is most famous for their chairs including rocking chairs.  Their factory in wsetin, moravia (vsetin, czechoslovakia) was built toward the end of 1869. J&J Kohn were associated with renowned architects and designers from the turn of the century onward. J&J Kohn supervised the production of furniture by such leading figures as Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Kolornan Moser, and Hans (brother of Otto) Prutscher. The production of chairs, which conformed to the contour of the back, demanded a curved back. This proved exceptionally difficult in many moods such as Brentwood. In 1856 Michael Thonet solved this problem: after a lengthy period of watering and steaming began the bending of solid wood with the help of Sheet Iron Strips in Casting Moulds. This wood, which was cut as it had naturally grown, and in the direction of the grain was, in solid pieces, bent as the form or shape demanded. In 1842 Michael Thonet was granted the Patent ""Holz in beliebige Formen und Schweifungen zu biegen"" (Wood bending, in any Shape and Form) by the K.K. allgemeinen Hofkammer in Vienna. In 1853 the Patent was renewed and remained upright until 1869. Once the Patent expired the Bentwood industry rapidly developed, so much so, that by 1893, 51 companies (25 in Austria-Hungary), including J&J Kohn, was in production. And by 1869, J&J Kohn immediately became Thonet`s most serious rival. While Thonet required one to two hours to make their wooden rods flexible using steam, their rival Kohn had installed a machine, which could produce these parts within 3 - 5 minutes. This allowed, the 4 factories belonging to the Kohn brothers to produce 5,500 pieces of furniture daily. In the 1870s and 1880s, the firm imitated and varied successful Thonet models, often adopting the Thonet model numbers for identical chairs of their own production. In 1899, the firm appointed Gustav Siegel, a pupil of Josef Hoffmann at the wiener kunstgewerbeschule (Vienna School of Applied Arts), as head of the firm`s design department. Siegel was probably responsible for a majority of the furniture designs produced between 1899 and 1914. In 1907 the J&J Kohn factories employed about 6,000 workers. The firm was awarded a Grand Prix at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. The firm participated in the 1901 Winter Exhibition at the Österreichisches Museum für Kunst und Industrie in Vienna, the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative Arts in Turin in 1902, and the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition in Saint Louis in 1904. Kohn also showed at exhibitions in Milan, London, and Bucharest in 1906, at the Kunstschau in Vienna in 1908, and in Buenos Aires and Munich in 1910.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Adolf Loos (1870-1933)","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) J & J Kohn Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","17"" Width x 19"" Depth x 33"" Height19"" Seat Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

McCobb, like his contemporaries Harvey Probber and George Nelson, helped introduce Americans to modular furniture. McCobb, who never received any formal design training, first established a studio in 1945. He worked primarily as a decorator and retail display designer, eventually turning his attention to furniture: by 1950, B.G. Mosberg was marketing his stylish, affordable Planner Group. Other, more luxurious collections followed, including the Directional, Predictor Linear, and Perimeter lines, all produced by Winchendon Furniture and marketed by McCobb himself. McCobb`s pieces were flexible and practical, designed to meet the needs of post World War II middle-class lifestyles. For example, his ""living walls"", complete with moveable room dividers and storage systems, allowed for maximum efficiency in limited spaces. He became a household name in the 1950`s, earning himself the nickname ""America`s Decorator"". His work was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","60"" Diameter Top x 29.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","ORIGINAL VINTAGE FIRTZ HANSEN ""SWAN"" CHAIRS, MODEL NO. 3320

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Eames Cowhide Aluminum Group Lounge Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.75"" Weigth x 17"" Depth x 32"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Reupholstered"

Their discoveries led to a commission from the U.S. Navy in 1942 to develop plywood splints, stretchers, and glider shells molded under heat and pressure. 

After World War II, they adapted the technology to create inexpensive, high-quality chairs that could be mass-produced. The process eliminated the extraneous wood needed to connect the seat with the back, which reduced the weight and visual profile of the chair and established a basis for modern furniture design. The chair is in the permanent collection of New York`s Museum of Modern Art.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Molded Plywood Chair DCM Design","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","19.5"" Width x 22.5"" Depth x 29.5"" Height; Seat Height 18""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Refinished"

"(1) Knoll Style Bertoia Seat Cushion Black New- Reproduction Velcro Strap","MR6693","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Harry Bertoia

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Black Bertoia Side Chair Cushions

Born 1932 Munich, Germany. Richard Sapper`s training in philosophy, anatomy, business and engineering at the University of Munich have not been forgotten during his design career. He has designed a range of household products and experimental transportation products that encompass clever modern design, at once beautiful, practical, and sensitive to the needs and desires of consumers. Clients include Artemide, Allessi and IBM. He designed the Lambda chair in conjunction with Marro Zanusso. His main interest has always been the design of technically complex objects, from ships, chairs, watches, radios, cars, bicycles, coffeepots and toothbrushes, with fifteen of his products on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Among this distinguished group is the Knoll Sapper office chair, introduced in 1979. Sapper is the recipient of 10 Compasso d`Oro prizes.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","KNOLL SAPPER EXECUTIVE CHAIR

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

American furniture designer, born Kansas, and active California and Utah. Baughman’s family moved to Long Beach, California in the mid 1920s. 
A highly creative child, he was given carte blanche at age 13 to design the new family home. Baughman served in the Air Force during World War II, and also designed officer`s clubs. After the war, he studied architecture and product design at the Art Center School of Los Angeles, and the California School of the Arts. 
His training complete, Baughman took a job with the Frank Brothers department store, an emporium noted for its design focus. He worked as a salesman and a window dresser; on the side, he became involved with the influential publication Furniture Forum. His growing reputation soon attracted furniture manufacturer Glenn of California, which hired Baughman to design a new collection. Working mainly with walnut, formica and wrought iron, Baughman created simple, understated pieces; many were conceived as space dividers, functioning admirably in the open plan interiors characteristic of the California Modern style. 
After briefly running his own workshop, Baughman began a long and fruitful association in 1953 with Thayer Coggin, a North Carolina furniture company. His accessibly stylish furniture proved very popular with middle class consumers, and he quickly became a household name. He has designed hundreds of pieces for Thayer Coggin to date; among the noteworthy are the 820-400 chaise (1954), the leather and chrome 951-103 arm chair (1962), and the Shelter sofa (1967). 
Baughman`s work was included in the Whitney Museum`s 1985 exhibit ""High Styles: Twentieth Century American Design"". In recognition of his monumental impact on American taste, Baughman was inducted into the Furniture Designers Hall of Fame in 1987. Today, he directs the Environmental Design Department at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","5ft Modern 1970 Milo Baughman","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","68"" Long x 38"" Wide x 29"" High","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Condition"

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 
From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 
In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Alvar Aalto ICF Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","19.5"" Width x 22"" Depth x 31.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent"

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Of Dunbar Edward Wormley Walnut Side Coffee Tables","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","32"" Width X 32"" Depth X 22.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Refinished"

The Leap chair`s back changes shape to support the entire spine. This can reduce the chance of lower back sag and a hunched posture, which weakens disc walls, stresses back ligaments and causes deterioration of the spine. 

Upper and Lower back controls 
Meet the different support needs of your upper and lower back. 

Height, Depth, Width, and Pivot Arms 
Arms telescope in and out, move forward and back, pivot and adjust up and down so you can find a natural position that comfortably supports the wrists, forearms, shoulders and neck. 

Natural Glide System
As you recline, the seat glides forward so you can recline without leaving your Vision and Reach Zone, so you stay oriented to your work. This encourages more varied postures so there`s less static load on the spine.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom Sectional Desk Features: White Laminate Top Solid Walnut Base1941 Scandinavian design  Risom’s tables display the same sturdy, straightforward construction that represents his distinctive style  Wonderful for a library or home schoolers with children","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","99 1/4"" Length X 24 1/4"" Width X 41 1/4"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Original Bertoia Full Diamond Chair Cushion

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 
Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Platner Wire Side Occasional Table

Philippe Starck was born in Paris on 18th January 1949 the son of an aircraft designer, it is he who probably inspired the young Starck. Even at a very early age Starck showed enthusiasm for design. Starck lives and works in Paris. 
Much of his work produced in the 1980`s and 1990`s was influenced by fashion and novelty. It has even been referred to by some as being `overdesigned`. In the 21st century his approach to design seems to have changed. 
Products designed by Starck can be seen on display in the collections of a number of European and American museums, among them the Brooklyn Museum in New York, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Museum of Design in London. Exhibitions of his work, either alone or in conjunction with that of other designers, have been held, among other places, in Paris, Marseille, Rome, Munich, Düsseldorf, Kyoto, Tokyo, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ploof Two Seater Sofa Couch

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 
One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.
Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art DÃ©co style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","T.H.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller Eames Leather Lounge 670 C1956

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Early Edition Jens Risom Lounge Chairs

Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4ft Vintage Burl Olive Ash Low Coffee Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","48"" Length X 48"" Depth  X 10"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good, A few negligible knicks"

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Knoll Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","40"" Width x 40"" Depth x 17"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","36"" Vintage Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Occasional Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Top Diameter 36"" x Height 28.5","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) White Knoll Bertoia Mesh Chair

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

 Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. The influential architectural critic Esther McCoy called their molded plywood chair “the chair of the century”. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day Another company, Vitra International, manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O’Hare Airports.

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work.
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts.
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Herman Miller Pencil Drawer

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","null","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","22"" Width x 24"" Depth x 31.5"" Height
