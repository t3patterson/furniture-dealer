"Herman Miller Eames Dining Table Eiffel Tower Chairs","MR8436","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Charles and Ray Eames

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Eames Dining Set","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Chairs: 18.75"" Width x 22"" Depth x 30.5"" Height.

"Vintage Howard Miller George Nelson Saucer Bubble Lamp","MR8203","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Howard Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Saucer Bubble Lamp 
George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947 


George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947. Howard Miller continued to sell the line throughout the late 1970`s after which they were discontinued. George Nelson never named the different lamp designs and they were simply given numbers by Howard Miller. A large Saucer lamp was simply sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-727"", a large Ball lamp was sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-725"". Howard Miller sold a variety of handy accessories for the lamps including a tripod base of satin chrome or brass-finished steel, swing arms, adjustable pulley fixture, etc. Also interesting to note is that all Bubble Lamps were available with criss-cross wire pattern except models H-725, H-726, H-727 and H-728. In order to get a criss-cross wire pattern from your dealer, you simply specified the order with ""CC"" after the lamp number. 

Howard Miller did not sell the lamps directly, rather outsourced the sales to ""Richards Morgenthau, Inc"" who handled their national sales. In the 1990`s Modernica reissued the ""Bubble Lamp"" line and ""named"" each individual Bubble Lamp design, for example Saucer, Ball, Criss-Cross, etc. The image on the top right was created by George Nelson Associates and was printed on most sales brochures of the Bubble lamps.

"33"" x 25"" Collograph By Hawaiian Artist Louis Pohl","MR8644","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/artist.jpg","Louis Pohl 
(1915 - 1999) 

Born in 1915, in Cincinnati, Louis was the oldest of 6 children. A childhood bout with rheumatic fever made it impossible to walk without excruciating pain and prevented Louis from entering school until he was 8 years old. To keep Louis busy while his brothers were in school, his parents would give him papers and pencils with which to draw. He was always drawing - that is what he knew best. 
Good fortune smiled on young Louis and set his life on a path that would ultimately bring him to Hawaii to live and work. An act of generosity would change Louis` life forever and continue to open opportunities for him throughout his life. 
Louis was 14 when the Great Depression in progress and he worked as a caddy during the summer at the local golf course. A regular foursome of well-to-do women had a very special bet. The loser would make their caddy`s wish come true. Louis waited patiently for his turn. The loser on that day was Mrs.Yaeger. Louis dared to say to her what he had rehearsed in his mind for two years, “I want to go to art school.” 
Mrs. Yaeger invited Louis to her house to discuss the matter, but he was too shy so he sent his father over to the house with his drawings. Without hesitation, she told Mr. Pohl to have Louis report to the Cincinnati Art Museum the next day explaining she would pay the tuition for one year. 
However, this presented a problem as there was hardly enough money for the large family during the Depression, let alone the extras for Louis to go to art school across town. To earn tokens for the streetcar ride to school, Louis did chores for his uncle Ott everyday. His best friend, Bob Fabe, begged his mother to make big lunches to share with Louis. Louis and Bob pulled pranks on each other and challenged each other to do more and better work.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Collograph by the well known Hawaiian artist Louis Pohl 

Louis Pohl developed his own special technique of collagraphic printing utilizing mixed media to achieve the varying textures and intensities that he felt were lacking in the traditional methods being used. The short life expectancy of the boards generally limited the number of prints that could be generated in this fashion and along with the individual variations from one print to the next this provided the different attributes upon which the individual prints are valued.

In 1992, Davis met Wolfgang Mezger when they licensed the Tao Desk Collection from Renz in Germany. This desk collection offered Davis their first clean contemporary desk line for the American market, and it is their best selling casegood line to date. 
From this initial relationship, Davis knew that Wolfgang’s attention to detail, design flair, and versatility in design would take their products into new directions. In 1998, Davis asked this talented designer to create a modular working lounge that would offer the customer a way to customize their lounge area. In 2000, the Palette Lounge Series was introduced, and grew in one year to be the second best selling product. The unique pallet construction allows designers to specify each component…from bench seat to arm seat…from glass table to tablet arm. The unit supports people working separately or together, as well as offers power and data connections.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Davis Wolfgang Mezger Stacking Side Zeno Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Incomparable workmanship. Unsurpassed quality. A quest for perfection. It’s what Howard C. Miller insisted on when he founded the company back in 1926,","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Acrylic Plastic Pendulum Clock made by Howard Miller Clock Company

"Trees In Snow Photograph Alfred Eisenstaedt Switzerland","MR8650","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Alfred Eisenstaedt 
(December 6, 1898 – August 24, 1995) was a German American photographer and photojournalist. He is renowned for his candid photographs, frequently made using a 35mm Leica M3 rangefinder camera. He is best known for his photograph capturing the celebration of V-J Day. [2] 

Eisenstaedt was successful enough to become a full-time photographer in 1929. Four years later he photographed a meeting between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in Italy. Other notable pictures taken by Eisenstaedt in his early career include a waiter ice skating in St. Moritz in 1932 and Joseph Goebbels at the League of Nations in Geneva in 1933. Although initially friendly, Goebbels scowled for the photograph when he learned that Eisenstaedt was Jewish.[3] 
Because of oppression in Hitler`s Nazi Germany, Eisenstaedt emigrated to the United States in 1935, where he lived in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York, for the rest of his life.[4] He worked as a photographer for Life magazine from 1936 to 1972. His photos of news events and celebrities, such as Dagmar, Sophia Loren and Ernest Hemingway, appeared on 90 Life covers.[2]","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Trees In Snow Photograph Alfred Eisenstaedt Switzerland 1947

(1886 - 1962) 
Born in Prague, Frankl together with his fellow European Joseph Urban, was one of the pioneering Modern designers working in America before 1925, who laid the foundations of the American tradition of modern decoration. After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dining Table by Paul Frankl for Brown & Saltman

"Herman Miller Leather Walnut Desk & Chair Gilbert Rohde ~Reduced Price; Original Price Was $12,000","MR8580","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gilbert Rohde 
(American, 1894-1944) 
Designer Gilbert Rohde was born and raised in New York, the son of a cabinetmaker. He left high school to pursue a variety of jobs, landing a short stint at a local paper, the Bronx News, drawing political cartoons. In 1923 he turned the experience into a job as an illustrator at the Abraham & Strauss department store. Inspired by a trip to the Paris Exhibition in 1925, Rohde began designing furniture and his early work was sold at Lord & Taylor. An exuberant modernist, his pieces gleaned simplicity and rationalism from Bauhaus design and a sense of form and ornamentation from Art Deco. He worked predominantly in Bakelite and chrome, the materials that made up the visual vocabulary of the period. 
Between 1927-28 Rohde designed the interiors for Avedon fashion stores, where his wife was part of the advertising team. Heywood-Wakefield of Massachusetts began picking up his designs in 1930, with a bentwood chair being one of their most successful pieces. Restless for a more substantial opportunity, he went west to Grand Rapids, Michigan where companies like John Widdicomb and Herman Miller had turned the city into a hub of furniture design and manufacturing. Rohde attracted the interest of Herman Miller and began designing for them in 1931. The company had been making traditional pieces and historical reproductions and was close to bankruptcy when they accepted Rohde`s modern work in a last ditch attempt to stay afloat. Apparently the miracle they needed, Rohde convinced them that modernism was the reigning style and proved it with his designs for bedroom furniture shown at the 1933 Chicago World`s Fair. Fortified by their updated image, Herman Miller had Rohde design entire sets for living and dining rooms and began making plans to halt their production of traditional pieces. Rohde designed a popular line of modular office furniture for Herman Miller, and they would later reintroduce the bentwood chair he made for Heywood-Wakefield. He also acted as the Design Director for several years.
During his tenure with Herman Miller Rohde was also pursuing a number of outside projects. He made a line of chrome chairs for the Troy Sunshade Company in 1933 and also worked some with Thonet. His designs were exhibited at the show of Machine Art at the MoMA in 1934 as well as at the Art and Industry show inside New York`s RCA building. In 1939 he exhibited work at the New York World`s Fair. He acted as the director of the Design Laboratory, also in New York, from 1935-38, and was the head of industrial design at the NYU School of Architecture from 1939-43.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Reduced Price!!!

Austrian furniture manufacturing company. In 1849 Jacob Kohn (1791-1868) and his son Josef Kohn (1814-1884) founded a factory for the production of wooden building components in the Vsetín area of Moravia. They began a successful campaign to dispute MICHAEL THONET’s patent of 1856 for the production of bentwood furniture, and, in 1867, before Thonet voluntarily waived patent rights in 1869, they set up a company in Vsetín for the manufacture of bentwood, going into production in 1868. In 1914 J. & J.

"Early Edition Knoll Jens Risom Armless Lounge Chair","MR8996","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Knoll","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom 
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Early Edition Knoll Jens Risom Armless Lounge Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4ft Vintage Herman Miller Eames Base Marble Table Top","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","48"" Diameter x 29"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good Vintage"
"Vintage Leolux Dutch Four Seater Semi-Circular Sofa Couch","MR8270","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Leolux In 1934, the Zuid-Nederlandse Clubmeubelfabriek was established. With only a few workers, the company manufactured traditional furniture. The initial years were turbulent, certainly when the company was situated on the front line in 1944. After the war, the company came under the management of ""Boerenleenbank"", which was appointed by Ton Sanders to watch over it. A couple of years later in 1948, together with his brother Jan, he bought the Zuid-Nederlandse Clubmeubelfabriek with family money that they scraped together. As with many companies, the story only just starts to take shape following the initial years of ups and downs, from restrictions on spending, to the Korean and Hungarian crises. In order to make the best of it, the Dutch from the south used all the creativity of the few that worked there. The texts from that time are witness to the self-motivation and idealization. The name Leolux appeared now and then for individual model ranges. During the second half of the fifties, Danish and Italian designers entered the scene and they did not go unnoticed by the brothers. They admired the new foam materials, artificial leathers and other upholstery techniques, and applied them without hesitation. Classic seams were abandoned. Risk-taking formed a basic principle. The young designer, Harry de Groot, joined the company with heart and soul and together with the brothers put a modern collection together. The proud lion in the ZNClogo became the luxurious lion ""Leolux"", a brand name that would quickly cover the whole company.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Leolux Dutch Sofa Couch

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) George Nelson for Herman Miller Primavera Chests Desk/ Vanity

"(1) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Lounge Chair","MR8161","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Charles and Ray Eames
Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Lounge Chair

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stelton Arne Jacobsen Coffee & Tea Set18/8 stainless steel""Cylinda-line""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Coffee Pot

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Ward Bennett Leather Arm Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

He is also known for interiors, such as the Royalton and Paramount hotels in New York and for product designs including furniture for Kartell, Driade, and Flos crystal for Daum cutlery for Sasaki and domestic wares for Alessi","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Flos Philippe Starck Archimoon Soft Aluminum Lamps

Not flashy pieces at all, Knoll said that her own work ""filled in the gaps"" for star pieces by Bertoia and Saarinen, but today we know that they stand in a class all by themselves.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","6.5ft Knoll Oval Oak Conference Table

"4ft Vintage Jens Risom Walnut Desk Work Table","MR8170","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Jens Risom Design Inc","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4ft Vintage Jens Risom Desk Work Table

"12"" Antique Crams Imperial World Globe Vintage Brass","MR8323","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The George F Grand Company 
Since 1867 

George Franklin Cram was a civil war veteran who marched with Sherman prior to his career as a map publisher. On March 18, 1867, George F. Cram and his uncle, Rufus Blanchard, founded the company Blanchard & Cram in Evanston, IL. The company manufactured and sold maps and atlases. Cram became the sole owner two years later and renamed it the George F. Cram Company. They sold a wide variety of atlases—including the popular Unrivaled Atlas of the World which was printed continuously from the 1880s to 1952.
In 1921, George Cram sold his business to one of his largest customers, E.A. Peterson of the National Map Company. The companies were combined at 32 E. Georgia St. in Indianapolis. The CRAM name continued on. On March 24, 1928, George F. Cram died at the age of 86.
In 1932, the George F. Cram Company began manufacturing globes. In 1936, the company moved again to 730 E. Washington St. Today, that location is home to the Marion County Jail.
Mr. Loren B. Douthit joined the company in 1937 as a School Sales Field Manager to develop the potential of the school market. Between 1937 and 1966, Cram created a variety of educational maps and globes, including the Horizon Ring Globe. 
Loren Douthit became President and majority shareholder of the company in 1966. 
In March of 1968, CRAM moved again to 301 S. LaSalle St. where it remained for 38 years. Loren Douthit retired in 1978, passing the torch to his two sons. William Douthit became President and John Douthit became Vice-President.
CRAM remained in the Douthit family for 40 years until it was sold to another Indianapolis company, Herff Jones, in February 2005. Douthit family members continue to work for the company. CRAM moved to its newest location at 4719 W. 62nd St. on the Herff Jones corporate campus in 2006. It is now part of a 160,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility that allows CRAM to better serve its customers.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","12"" Imperial Vintage Brass The George F Cram Company Desk World Globe

1880 J.E. Hamilton Hollywood Type Company Wood Type 
The Hamilton Company was founded in 1880 by James Edward Hamilton, a skilled woodworker whose first product was wood type for the printing industry. The first wood type project completed by J.E. Hamilton was ""Grand Ball."" Mr. Hamilton operated his foot powered scroll saw and mounted the letters on another block of wood. He then sanded and polished the surface of the wood type. The business grew and prospered and by 1891 the Hamilton Company employed 200 workers and was doing approximately $500,000 worth of business. 
Hamilton Manufacturing Company 
Drafting Furniture 
How the Drafting Furniture came to be a successful part of the Hamilton story is really a parallel to the story of 20th Century America. 
At the turn of the century the drafting industry was almost nonexistent. The engineering drawing that accompanied an order to the shop was probably the original drawing, done by a draftsperson, on an old board, set up on sawbucks. World War I came along and items had to be produced in a hurry. 
Mass production became a reality and tracing paper had to be used for the original drawing so that prints could be made and distributed to many men in the shop so many articles of the same kind or for the same end product could be produced at once. Because of the time and effort put into the original, the Drawings Storage Cabinetry was a natural addition to the company. From Fully Adjustable Tables to Filing Systems, Hamilton products were always in the forefront.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","10ft Industrial Age Hamilton Drafting Table

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage George Nelson Herman Miller Chair

"(3) Vintage GF Goodform Adjustable Aluminum Chairs","MR8991","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF)
The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(3) Vintage General Fireproofing Adjustable Aluminum Chair Model 2123

"Vintage Jens Risom Wood Lounge Arm Chair SOLD","MR8751","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Jens Risom Designs, Inc.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom lounge chair by Jens Risom Designs, Inc.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller Pedestal Side Table

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum

Bernini S.P.A. Italy","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","The architect Gaetano Pesce was born in 1939 in La Spezia, Italy. He attended the school of Architecture of Venice from 1958 to 1963. He has lived in many European cities – Padua, Venice, London, Helsinki, Paris – and since 1980, in New York. His multidisciplinary work is present in the permanent collections of Museums in France, Finland, the United States, England, Portugal and Italy. Gaetano Pesce has been teaching for twenty-six years at the École d’Architecture de Strasbourg and has lectured in the most prominent Universities and Cultural Institutions around the world. He has worked in France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United States, Brazil and Belgium. Pesce’s works are often memorable for their ability to give an unexpected twist to favorite themes: the “diversified series”, the twin functionality of objects and architecture, the creative use of colour, the political dimension of the project, the theory and practice of the “poorly executed”, the use and development of synthetic materials, the theory of the “femininity” of architectural projects and the “culture of objects”.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Gaetano Pesce 543 Broadway High Chair

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

"Vitra Alberto Meda Red Leather Task Office Chair Enron","MR8143","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","VITRA","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Alberto Meda 

Alberto Meda was born in Lenno, Tremezzina, Italy, in 1945. He studied at Milan Polytechnic until 1969 but, unlike most Italian designers, Alberto Meda studied mechanical engineering there instead of architecture. Between 1973 and 1979, Alberto Meda was technical director at Kartell, where he was responsible for plastics technologies and furniture production. From 1979 Alberto Meda was self-employed as a designer in Milan. Alberto Meda was a technical design consultant for Brevetti Gaggia, the coffee-machine maker, and for Alfa Romeo (1981-1985). His rigorous training as a mechanical engineer has certainly stood Alberto Meda in good stead; it has also induced him to give priority to construction at the outset of a project rather than the formal aspects of design. Alberto Meda is always concerned with working out new materials solutions. The boundless possibilities afforded by modern technology are viewed by Alberto Meda as a ""supermarket of creative possibilities"", which he knows how to exploit in his designs with virtuosic versatility. Another highly sophisticated Alberto Meda construction is the award-winning ""Meda chair"" (1997), which does not in the least resemble a simple office chair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vitra Meda Arm Chair

The Meda Chair successfully combines comfort, technology and a new aesthetics. The comfortable and flexible armchair follows the movements of the user’s body - even though it deliberately does not rely on any complicated mechanisms.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

"Vintage Gilbert Rohde Herman Miller Sleeping Sofa 1940","MR8582","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gilbert Rohde 
American, 1894-1944 

It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. Then he met D. J. DePree. DePree also had a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. `This calls for a different kind of furniture,` he said. 
Could Rohde design such furniture, DePree asked? Yes. Would he design such furniture for Herman Miller? Yes. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You`re not making furniture anymore,` Rohde told DePree. `You`re providing a way of life.` 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (`rotorettes`) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place and a radical departure from the standard living or dining room `suites` purchased at the time. 
And with the introduction of Rohde`s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market. 
Rohde`s groundbreaking designs, however, were not an easy sell to mainstream retailers unschooled in the new design concepts. Their lack of understanding led to another of Rohde`s revolutionary ideas: the manufacturer`s showroom, which he transformed into a centre where knowledgeable representatives could talk about furniture they understood and appreciated. 
A true innovator and pioneer, Gilbert Rohde set the stage for those who followed him at Herman Miller in the 40s and 50s, including George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames. It was Rohde who took Herman Miller into the world of modern design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Reduced Price!!!!

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Eames Dining Conference Table

"Vintage General Fireproofing Adjustable Aluminum Chair","MR8211","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 

In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 

The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 

The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 

During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 

Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage General Fireproofing Adjustable Aluminum Chair Model 2123

(1902 – 1995) 

“Photography can be just a matter of luck.”

Dmitri Kessel was born in the Russian Ukraine on his family’s sugar plantation. His most prized possession as a kid was his Brownie camera which his father gave him when he was 14. When his family’s possessions were confiscated during the Bolshevik Revolution, Dmitri managed to keep his camera, but this too was destroyed when a Russian soldier broke it over Dmitri`s head. He escaped from Russia via Rumania and immigrated to America in 1923. 
During his 60-year career, Kessel worked as an industrial photographer, a war correspondent and combat photographer, and a photo essayist for LIFE. During World War II, he sailed on convoy escorts in the North Atlantic, covered the landing of American troops in the Aleutian Islands and the British landing in Greece. He also photographed the Greek civil war. 
In later years, Kessel lived on the Yangtze River in China for seven months while producing a photo essay for LIFE. He photographed the Andes Mountains in South America and mining operations in Central Africa. 
Kessel is world famous for the fidelity of his camera recreations of great art, but was also a tough and adventurous new photographer.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eiffel Tower Photograph Dmitri Kessel Paris 1948

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller George Nelson Pedestal End Table 5453

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) White & Black Knoll Bertoia Mesh Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Width 21"" x Depth 18"" x Height 30.5""

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Knoll Brno Leather Stainless Steel Side Chairs Set","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23"" Width x 22"" Depth x 32"" Height

By the early 1960s Lammhults was looking to expand its design identity and they invited the well-known design partners Lindau & Lindekrantz to work with them. In 1965 Lammhults asked Lindau & Lindekrantz to design a chair for public use. Instead of one chair, Lindau and Lindekrantz offered two: Ritz and Royal.
 
The chairs were the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration 
that was to last for two decades.
 
Over the course of the next 20 years, Lindau & Lindekrantz 
created scores of designs for Lammhults, establishing the company 
as a reference point for leading Scandinavian design.

During Lammhult´s collaboration with Börge Lindau and Bo Lindekrantz, a number of important furniture designs were developed.
 
A collection of Lindau & Lindekrantz designs are still in production, for example the S70-3 barstool and X75-2 armchair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Shelby Williams Stacking Wood Side Dining Chair","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","21.5"" Width x 22"" Depth x 30"" Height

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Wormley Two Tier Cocktail Coffee Table Drexel Precedent

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Modern Wall Desk By George Nelson

Born in Prague, Frankl together with his fellow European Joseph Urban, was one of the pioneering Modern designers working in America before 1925, who laid the foundations of the American tradition of modern decoration. After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","End Table by Paul Frankl","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","27"" Width x 10"" Depth x 23"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","18 ft Herman Miller Eames Conference Table

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Thonet Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

"Vintage Howard Miller George Nelson Lantern Bubble Lamp","MR8199","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Howard Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Lantern Bubble Lamp 
George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947 

George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947. Howard Miller continued to sell the line throughout the late 1970`s after which they were discontinued. George Nelson never named the different lamp designs and they were simply given numbers by Howard Miller. A large Saucer lamp was simply sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-727"", a large Ball lamp was sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-725"". Howard Miller sold a variety of handy accessories for the lamps including a tripod base of satin chrome or brass-finished steel, swing arms, adjustable pulley fixture, etc. Also interesting to note is that all Bubble Lamps were available with criss-cross wire pattern except models H-725, H-726, H-727 and H-728. In order to get a criss-cross wire pattern from your dealer, you simply specified the order with ""CC"" after the lamp number. 

Howard Miller did not sell the lamps directly, rather outsourced the sales to ""Richards Morgenthau, Inc"" who handled their national sales. In the 1990`s Modernica reissued the ""Bubble Lamp"" line and ""named"" each individual Bubble Lamp design, for example Saucer, Ball, Criss-Cross, etc. The image on the top right was created by George Nelson Associates and was printed on most sales brochures of the Bubble lamps.

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York’s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 
One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber’s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torches and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.
Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe’s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torches whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and ‘40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair T.

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates. A number of Saarinen`s chairs for Knoll were to become landmarks in the history of 20th century design","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Saarinen Office Side Arm Chair

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Milo Baughman Olive Burl Leather Settee

"(1) Vintage Ward Bennett Brickel Armchair Taupe Suede","MR8409","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Brickel Associates","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett
Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Ward Bennett Brickel Armchairs Taupe Suede

"(4) General Fireproofing Adjustable Aluminum Chairs","MR8206","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 

In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 

The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 

The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 

During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 

Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Vintage General Fireproofing Adjustable Aluminum Chair Model 2123

"(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs","MR8050","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Bertoia Side Chair with back pad and seat cushion

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Three Edward Wormley Stacking Unit","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Each cube side is 15.5""","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent >restored"

interior architect 

Ilmari Tapiovaara graduated in 1937 as interior architect from the department of furniture design of the Central School of Arts and Crafts. After graduating, he travelled to France to visit the Paris World’s Fair. On this trip, he obtained an assistant’s position for six months at the office of Le Corbusier. 

In 1938, Tapiovaara was engaged by the Asko company, Finland’s largest furniture factory, as designer and artistic director. In the autumn of 1939, a housing fair was staged in Helsinki, which, however, had to be closed before long because of the risk of war. The exhibition featured a multipurpose set of furniture designed by Tapiovaara for Asko. In 1941, Tapiovaara became the artistic and commercial director of the Keravan Puuteollisuus furniture company. In 1946-47, he and his wife Annikki Tapiovaara designed furniture for the new Domus Academica student-housing complex in Helsinki. One of the best-known items among those designs is the Domus chair, which began to be produced in series. Tapiovaara’s Lukki chair was meant for the student housing facilities of the Helsinki University of Technology, which were built in the early 1950s. The innovation of this chair design was its combination of form-pressed plywood and curved metal tubing.

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","A pair of Dunbar side tables by Edward Wormley

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Eames Fiberglass Armchair On Wooden Rocker Base

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 
Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Knoll Bertoia Bar and Counter Stools

The PH Artichoke is considered to be a classical masterpiece made by Poul Henningsen more than 40 years ago. The structure is made of twelve steel arches. On this structure PH placed 72 copper “leaves” in twelve circular rows with six blades in each row. Because each row is staggered from the previous, all 72 leaves are able to “cover for each other”. This design allows viewing the fixture from any angle without being able to see the light source located in the center of the PH Artichoke. The original PH Artichokes were developed for a restaurant in Copenhagen called the Langelinie Pavilion, and they are still hanging there today. 

PH Artichoke (1958) is a 360-degree glare free luminaire created by 72 leaves, which shield the light source, redirect and reflect the light onto the underlying leaves, giving distinct, unique illumination.

Richard Sapper`s training in philosophy, anatomy, business and engineering at the University of Munich have not been forgotten during his design career. He has designed a range of household products and experimental transportation products that encompass clever modern design, at once beautiful, practical, and sensitive to the needs and desires of consumers. Clients include Artemide, Allessi and IBM. He designed the Lambda chair in conjunction with Marro Zanusso. His main interest has always been the design of technically complex objects, from ships, chairs, watches, radios, cars, bicycles, coffeepots and toothbrushes, with fifteen of his products on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Among this distinguished group is the Knoll Sapper office chair, introduced in 1979.

"(3) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs","MR8051","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(3) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs

"C&B ITALIA Amanta Mario Bellini Fiberlite Side Table","MR8141","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","C&B ITALIA 
B&B Italia
(established 1974)
Originally launched in 1966 as C&B Italia by Cesare Cassina and Pietro Busnelli this Italian firm`s work specialized in Polyurethane furniture, for which it soon established a reputation as an innovator. This was sustained by the establishment in 1968 of a research centre under architect and furniture designer Francesco Binfaré. C&B Italia commissioned many leading Italian designers to explore the exciting possibilities of this new medium, including Mario Bellini, who contributed the Amanta chair in 1966, and Gaetano Pesce, who designed the Up chair in 1970. However, the company`s success was such that Cesare Cassina withdrew on account of the strong competition it afforded his own Cassina furniture manufacturing company. Since its retitling as B&B Italia in 1974, the company has continued to innovate in design and materials, particularly its main outputs in polyurethane furniture. Leading designers working for the company have included Afra and Tobia Scarpa (whose designs included the Artone chair of 1985), Vico Magistretti (whose work included the Quartetto and Sestetto tables of 1974), Antonio Citterio (whose output included the Sity sofa of 1980), and Paola Nava (whose designs included the Baia sofa of 1977).","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Mario Bellini 
Born in Milan in 1935, Mario Bellini graduated in architecture from the Milan Polytechnic in 1959, and set up practice as an architect in the early sixties. 
His work ranges from urban design and architecture to furnishing and industrial products. Renowned as designer, in 1963 he began his relationship with Olivetti in charge of industrial design, and went on to work with other companies both in Italy and abroad, amongst which Cassina. He won the Compasso d`Oro and other international awards more than once, and his work is exhibited in the MoMA collection in New York, which, in 1987, dedicated a personal retrospective exhibition to his work. Since the 80`s he has worked mainly in the field of architecture all over the world. His most well known work includes the Portello buildings for the Milan Fair, the conference centre of Villa Erba at Como, the extension of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and of the International Fair of Essen. From 1986 to 1991 he was director of the Domus magazine. In 1987, in continuing the work of his studio opened in the 60`s, he founded Mario Bellini Associates, of which he is the president, whose services run from masterplanning to architecture and the design of stands and sets for exhibitions and museums. In 1996 product and furniture design were transferred to the Bellini Atelier, which he founded with his son Claudio. 
A winning duo: a mix of independence and interaction. Two generations in one family exchange integrate and confront each other. A special relationship characterized by reciprocal autonomy and by a deep understanding when working on shared projects. A constructive family bond that generates a positive drive enhancing creative energies and managerial skills.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Original Mario Bellini ""Amanta"" Coffee Tableby C&B Italia","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23.5"" Square x 14.25"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Thayer Coggin Settee Sofa Designed by","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","61"" Width x 34"" Depth x 28Height

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century.
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work.
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts.
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stendig Wassily Marcel Breuer Leather Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Flat Bar Side Chair

Don Chadwick studied industrial design at the University of California Los Angeles until 1959. In 1964 he opened a design practice and from 1974 collaborated with office furniture makers Hermann Miller. For Hermann Miller Don Chadwick designed the ""Modular Seating"" system of upholstered furniture in 1974, which consists of five, simple, cloth-covered modules that can be endlessly combined to make sofas. At that time Bill Stumpf was assistant director of the Hermann Miller research division. Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf collaborated on developing ""Ergon"" (1970-1976), an office chair that set new standards of ergonomic seating. In 1977 they opened Chadwick, Stumpf & Associates, a design agency in Winona, Minnesota. Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf continued to develop highly innovative office chairs for Hermann Miller. In 1984 they developed ""Ergon"" further as the ""Equa"" office chair with a flexible back that made this chair even more comfortable to sit on. In 1992 Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf developed the ""Aeron"" chair with a seat and back made of breathable, posture-conforming polyester fabric. Since this chair did not have to be elaborately upholstered, production time was considerably reduced.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Chadwick Task Chair

Probber, a design autodidact in a profession largely dominated by formal architectural training, began his creative career at age 16 when he designed a sofa. Eventually, he established a workshop, Harvey Probber Inc., in Brooklyn, later moving his operations to Massachusetts. 

An astute observer, Probber realized that the nature of post-WWII American indoor life had fundamentally changed: rooms no longer had strictly assigned functions, and the new open plan interior demanded furnishings of greater flexibility. Probber, with his finger on the pulse of the times, responded in 1944 with the invention of modular seating; no mean accomplishment for one not given to academic posturing. 

Despite his lack of formal training, Probber lead an active and original creative life, as displayed through his renderings of interiors, and the witty caricatures he drew throughout his life of ""chairs as people,"" which served to keep his creative mind in shape. 

His pieces themselves displayed the same combination of high style and popular appeal: his were no sterile creations in tubular steel; Probber´s work shares more in common with Art Deco than with the machine aesthetic of the Bauhaus. It often combined rare woods, sumptuous fabrics and sinuous lines with just the right amount of avant-garde sensibility to make them widely practical and appealing and as a result his furniture set the tone for American indoor life starting in the 1950´s. 

Probber´s work has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years, and has become particularly collectible. He was not a household name in his lifetime as were some of his contemporaries Charles and Ray Eames, His ""sling chair"" was included in the famed MoMA 1951 Good Design exhibition.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Harvey Probber Chrome Flatbar Leather Lounge Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Knoll Cesca Side Chairs Cane","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23 1/2"" Width x 23 1/2"" Depth x 31 1/2"" Height

Trained as an architect, Florence Knoll`s own pieces for Knoll are simple, architectural designs that stand the test of time. Her lounge seating, sofas, tables, and storage adapt flawlessly to any environment, with their clean, linear design and incredibly durable, high-quality construction. These pieces are built to last a lifetime - or several lifetimes. Not flashy pieces at all, Knoll said that her own work ""filled in the gaps"" for star pieces by Bertoia and Saarinen, but today we know that they stand in a class all by themselves.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Verdi Alpi Marble Conference Dining Oval Table

"Vintage Walnut Milo Baughman Corner Sofa Table SOLD","MR8297","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Milo Baughman 
Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Walnut Milo Baughman Corner Sofa Table

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

"Vintage Howard Miller George Nelson Pear Bubble Lamp","MR8202","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Howard Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Pear Bubble Lamp 
George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947 


George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947. Howard Miller continued to sell the line throughout the late 1970`s after which they were discontinued. George Nelson never named the different lamp designs and they were simply given numbers by Howard Miller. A large Saucer lamp was simply sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-727"", a large Ball lamp was sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-725"". Howard Miller sold a variety of handy accessories for the lamps including a tripod base of satin chrome or brass-finished steel, swing arms, adjustable pulley fixture, etc. Also interesting to note is that all Bubble Lamps were available with criss-cross wire pattern except models H-725, H-726, H-727 and H-728. In order to get a criss-cross wire pattern from your dealer, you simply specified the order with ""CC"" after the lamp number. 

Howard Miller did not sell the lamps directly, rather outsourced the sales to ""Richards Morgenthau, Inc"" who handled their national sales. In the 1990`s Modernica reissued the ""Bubble Lamp"" line and ""named"" each individual Bubble Lamp design, for example Saucer, Ball, Criss-Cross, etc. The image on the top right was created by George Nelson Associates and was printed on most sales brochures of the Bubble lamps.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944. 
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. 
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(7) Ward Bennett Dining Armchairs

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Vintage Arne Jacobsen Fritz Hansen Series 7 Bar Stools Set

John O. Van Koert, a prominent New York designer who helped promote the fascination with Danish modern furnishings in the 1950`s. 
Mr. Van Koert designed silverware and furniture that helped to introduce modernist shapes. Born in Manitoba, Canada, he later moved to Milwaukee, where he studied at the University of Wisconsin to be a painter and sculptor and taught design in the art department. After World War II, he settled in New York as a jewelry designer for Harry Winston and branched out into industrial design. 
His flatware designs in silver for Towle were well known in the 50`s. One of them, ``Contour,`` a sleek Miro-like design, was chosen to represent modernism in ``Knife, Fork and Spoon,`` a 1951 traveling exhibition on the history of eating implements organized by the Walter Art Center of Minneapolis. 
In 1954, he was exhibition director of ``Design in Scandinavia,`` a show that traveled for three years, to venues including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; it helped introduce Scandinavian modern design to Americans. 
Mr. Van Koert`s furniture designs for Drexel, a North Carolina manufacturer, were presented in model rooms in department stores like Abraham & Straus, Macy`s and Bloomingdale`s. A 1956 installation of walnut furniture with rounded edges, silver-finished hardware and chartreuse upholstery was shown against purple, silver and electric-blue walls.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Danish Drexel ""Profile"" Line Dining","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Extended table: 98"" Length x 40"" Depth x 29"" Height

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Ward Bennett Leather Arm Chairs

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 
Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage B&B Italia Tobia Scarpa Wood Coffee Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","31.25"" Width x 15"" Depth x 16"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent >Restored"

"Vintage T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings Marble Table Lamp","MR8589","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings
In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York’s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 
One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber’s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.
Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe’s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Marble Table Lamp Designed by","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","3.5"" square base x 23"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","very good vintage

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Vintage Milo Baughman Chrome Bar Stools

The company’s history began as early as the 1840s. Louis Lebus, a Jewish immigrant cabinet-maker, came to 
Britain from Breslau in Germany. With no money and speaking only a little English, he settled in Hull before coming to London in 1857. His Whitechapel furniture workshop was so successful that in 1875 he moved to larger premises in Stepney. 
His son Harris Lebus (1852-1907) took over when Louis died in 1879. By 1885 the firm moved again - to Tabernacle Street, near Shoreditch, where the furniture-making industry was concentrated. During the 1890s Lebus’ became the largest furniture manufacturer in Britain, with a workforce of 1,000 people. By 1900, business was so successful that Harris Lebus needed to expand to meet customers’ demands. A large site was required to build a new factory away from the cramped streets of East London.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","60"" Lebus Furniture Walnut Dry Bar Buffet

"Vintage Howard Miller George Nelson Cigar Bubble Lamp","MR8194","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Howard Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Cigar Bubble Lamp 
George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947 


George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947. Howard Miller continued to sell the line throughout the late 1970`s after which they were discontinued. George Nelson never named the different lamp designs and they were simply given numbers by Howard Miller. A large Saucer lamp was simply sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-727"", a large Ball lamp was sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-725"". Howard Miller sold a variety of handy accessories for the lamps including a tripod base of satin chrome or brass-finished steel, swing arms, adjustable pulley fixture, etc. Also interesting to note is that all Bubble Lamps were available with criss-cross wire pattern except models H-725, H-726, H-727 and H-728. In order to get a criss-cross wire pattern from your dealer, you simply specified the order with ""CC"" after the lamp number.

Howard Miller did not sell the lamps directly, rather outsourced the sales to ""Richards Morgenthau, Inc"" who handled their national sales. In the 1990`s Modernica reissued the ""Bubble Lamp"" line and ""named"" each individual Bubble Lamp design, for example Saucer, Ball, Criss-Cross, etc. The image on the top right was created by George Nelson Associates and was printed on most sales brochures of the Bubble lamps.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Alexander Girard, born in 1907 in New York City, was one of the decisive figures of post-war American design alongside his close friends George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames. 
The focus of his broad oeuvre was on textile design: As head of the Herman Miller Company’s textile division, Girard designed a multitude of textiles that reflect his love of festive colours and patterns. He favoured abstract and geometric forms, typically put together in bright constellations of colours. 
His upholstery fabrics remain as timely and vital as ever with many of them still being sold today. Having originally studied architecture, Girard made a name for himself over his long career in the fields of furniture, exhibition and interior design as well as in the graphic arts. 
On his extended travels, he avidly collected textiles from all over the world, which furnished him with a source of inspiration and ideas. In 1993, the final year of his life, he bequeathed these holdings to the Vitra Design Museum Collection along with the contents of his studio (hundreds of drawings, prototypes and textile samples).","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Herman Miller Marble and Aluminum Side Tables Designed by Alexander Girard","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","20"" x 20"" top x 20.5 height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Top >Excellent showroom sample"

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Van Der Rohe Brno Chair 

The first and still the most elegant of its kind, the Brno Chair by Mies van der Rohe is a masterpiece of structure. Designed in 1930 for the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Brilliance of form and function shown in the construction of these chairs represents the beginnings of an intensely creative period in architecture known as the ""Bauhaus"" period.

"8.5ft Long Herman Miller George Nelson Platform Bench","MR8658","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","102"" Herman Miller Nelson Platform Bench 

Introduced in 1946, the Nelson platform bench remains a landmark of modern design. The clean, rectilinear lines reflect designer George Nelson`s architectural background and his insistence on what he called ""honest"" design - making an honest visual statement about an object`s purpose. The bench serves as a multipurpose display and resting place in offices, public areas, and homes.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","102.25"" Length x 18.5"" Depth x 14.25"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage"

"(7) Vintage GF Goodform Aluminum Model 4304 Side Chairs","MR8207","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 

In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 

The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 

The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 

During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 

Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage GF ""Goodform"" Model 4304 Side Chairs

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage. 
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Fritz Hansen Series 7 Side Chair by Arne Jacobsen

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates. A number of Saarinen`s chairs for Knoll were to become landmarks in the history of 20th century design","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Saarinen Dining Armless Side Chair

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(5) Ward Bennett Leather Arm Chairs

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Chrome Bar Stools

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

"Industrial Age GF Executive Aluminum Chair","MR8791","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage General Fireproofing Executive Aluminum Chair Model 2157

The ""Amedeo Cassina"" firm first saw the light of day officially at Meda (Milano) in 1927, on the initiative of the brothers Cesare and Umberto Cassina. The name was modified in 1935 to ""Figli di Amedeo Cassina"". 
At the outset practically the entire outputs was made up of small pieces of wooden furniture - small work-tables and living-room tables - being later extended to include armchairs and drawing-room furniture. 
The first Cassina furniture was eclectic in inspiration, but the melange of styles soon gave way to the generic middle-of-the-road","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Mario Bellini
Mario Bellini graduated from the Politecnico di Milano - Faculty of architecture in Milan in 1959 and began working as an architect himself in the early Sixties. Like many other Italian architects, his activities range from architecture and urban planning to product and furniture design. 
His early international success grew rapidly during the first two decades, especially in the design sector, and reached its peak in 1987 with the greatest acknowledgement expressed in a personal retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art of New York, which at the time already included 25 of his works in its Permanent Collection, including a remarkable set of Olivetti machines as well as the furniture for B&B and Cassina - such as the famous ""Cab"" chair - and the innovative office chairs designed for Vitra. 
His career as a product and furniture designer began in 1963. From 1963 to 1991 he was chief design consultant for Olivetti. For many years he designed furnishing products and systems for B&B Italia and Cassina, TV sets for Brionvega, and hi-fi systems and electric organs for Yamaha. For 5 years he worked as an automobile design consultant with Renault. In 1972 he was commissioned to design and build the prototype of the Kar-a-Sutra mobile environment for the exhibition “Italy: the New Domestic Landscape” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He has also designed for Fiat and Lancia, lamps for Artemide, Erco and Flos, and office furniture for Vitra. 
Other firms for whom he has designed and/or continues to design products include (in Italy) Acerbis, Bras, Driade, Candy, Castilia, Flou, Marcatrè, Meritalia, Natuzzi and Poltrona Frau; (in Belgium) Ideal Standard; (in Germany) Lamy and Rosenthal; (in Japan) Fuji and Zojirushi; and (in the USA) Heller. 
MBA`s headquarters of some 1,500 sq.m in Milan were designed by Mario Bellini himself in the early 1990s, and today an average of 30 to 35 architects. In 1999, MBA obtained ISO 9001 quality certification. 
He has taught in the major cultural centres in the world and has been awarded all the major international design and architecture prizes, 8 “Compasso d’oro” included. In December 2004 he was honored with the “Golden Medal” by Italian Republic President for his architectural and design work in the world. 
From 1986 to 1991, he was editor of Domus, the prestigious international monthly magazine of architecture, design and art.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Cassina 414 Cab Lounge Armchair 1982

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson for Herman Miller Bookcase","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","34"" width x 12"" depth x 29.75"" height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","very good vintage

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy.

The Aluminum Group chairs were originally developed in 1958 as a special project by Charles and Ray Eames for a private residence being designed by Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard. The seat-back suspension was a major technical achievement and represented a departure from the concept of the chair as a solid shell.

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage. 
During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","ORIGINAL VINTAGE FIRTZ HANSEN

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","7ft Vintage Herman Miller George Nelson Wood Credenza

He afterwards worked briefly as a naval architect, designing ocean liner interiors, and then as art director for a motion picture studio. In 1926, he became a salesman for an antiques dealer who specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture, and Robsjohn-Gibbings was assigned prominent accounts such as Elizabeth Arden and Neiman Marcus.In the late 1930s and 1940s he was the most important decorator in America.

Knopf, and Thelma Chrysler Foy.The design work of T. H. Robsjohn Gibbings is hallmarked as a modern mixture of the classical elements of Ancient Grecian design, and Art Deco design. It features mosaic floor reproductions, sculptural fragments, and sparse furnishings, all combining to achieve his trademark brand of modern historicism.T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings much preferred the visual vocabulary of the classical world, particularly ancient Greek furniture and design. Robsjohn-Gibbings` look was widely emulated, and, from 1943-56, he worked as a designer for the Widdicomb furniture company in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1960, he met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, which drew heavily on classical forms. It is still in production.

"5ft Danish Drexel ""Profile"" Credenza Buffet Walnut","MR8449","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Drexel

Drexel Heritage began on November 10, 1903 when five enterprising men from Morganton, North Carolina started a small furniture factory. Built on a tract of land where the wagon track crossed the railroad, it became known as Drexel. Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the area had an abundance of virgin timber including chestnut, oak, poplar, maple and walnut. Within three years, the 26,600-square-foot plant had 30 employees and average production was 50 pieces of furniture per week. The first product of their labor was a solid-oak, three-piece suite including a bureau, washstand and bed. It cost $14.50 wholesale. Today, the company`s combined manufacturing and distribution facilities total 2.3 million square feet. 
During the 1930s, as a result of the Depression, Drexel Heritage recognized the need to move away from commodity furniture toward designing home furnishings to appeal to its customers. A 13-person sales force was established and the first furniture designers were brought on board. In 1937, Drexel became the first furniture manufacturer to advertise in national magazines. 
Throughout World War II, all Drexel plants remained open. Wartime production included 50,000 government desks, 15 million tent stakes and millions of square feet of marine plywood for boats. About 4,000 bedroom suites were made for government housing at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The piece that prompted the most company pride was a custom desk created for General Douglas Macarthur. 
In 1956, Drexel acquired the successful Heritage Furniture Company from High Point, North Carolina, which was founded in 1932 by Elliott Wood. The two companies operated as separate divisions until 1974, when Drexel Enterprises and Heritage Furniture Company became Drexel Heritage.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","John O.

John O. Van Koert, a prominent New York designer who helped promote the fascination with Danish modern furnishings in the 1950`s. 
Mr. Van Koert designed silverware and furniture that helped to introduce modernist shapes. Born in Manitoba, Canada, he later moved to Milwaukee, where he studied at the University of Wisconsin to be a painter and sculptor and taught design in the art department. After World War II, he settled in New York as a jewelry designer for Harry Winston and branched out into industrial design. 
His flatware designs in silver for Towle were well known in the 50`s. One of them, ``Contour,`` a sleek Miro-like design, was chosen to represent modernism in ``Knife, Fork and Spoon,`` a 1951 traveling exhibition on the history of eating implements organized by the Walter Art Center of Minneapolis. 
In 1954, he was exhibition director of ``Design in Scandinavia,`` a show that traveled for three years, to venues including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; it helped introduce Scandinavian modern design to Americans. 
Mr. Van Koert`s furniture designs for Drexel, a North Carolina manufacturer, were presented in model rooms in department stores like Abraham & Straus, Macy`s and Bloomingdale`s. A 1956 installation of walnut furniture with rounded edges, silver-finished hardware and chartreuse upholstery was shown against purple, silver and electric-blue walls.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Danish Drexel ""Profile"" Credenza Buffet

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944. 
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. 
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Cane Back Side Chairs Orange Fabric Seat

"Edward Wormley for Dunbar Walnut Serving Cart Trolley SOLD","MR8716","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","DUNBAR 
As early as 1910, DUNBAR had established a reputation for providing the ultimate in quality handcrafted products to America’s most discriminating clientele. The original custom DUNBAR creations were the finest buggies and horse drawn carriages for the gentry class. With the introduction of the automobile, DUNBAR wisely transformed into one of America’s premier fine furnishings companies.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley
Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","by Edward Wormley for Dunbar","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","36"" width x 16"" depth x 29.25"" height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Barcelona Chair Mies Van Der Rohe

Created by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for his 1929 German Pavilion at the International Exhibition in Barcelona, the Barcelona Collection`s pure composition came to epitomize Modern architecture.

"80"" Jens Risom Mid Century Modern Wood Desk","MR8889","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Jens Risom","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","80"" Mid Century Modern Wood Desk Designed by Jens Risom for Jens Risom

"Donghia Club Chair Shell/Belaggio Collection","MR8474","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Donghia Furniture Co. 
New York 
The history of Donghia reflects Angelo Donghia’s dynamic approach to design. Though Mr. Donghia was first and always an interior designer, he entered the home furnishings market because he found a lack of innovative, quality products to use in his interiors. He turned his attention to fabric and wallcoverings in order to carry through his innovative interpretation of classical ideas. &Vice Versa was established in 1968 as a vehicle for wallcoverings and fabrics. The success of &Vice Versa led to the opening, in 1976, of the first Donghia Showroom in Los Angeles. In 1978, Donghia Furniture was established to produce fine upholstery and case pieces. In 1980 the name &Vice Versa was changed to Donghia Textiles. 
Donghia has always focused its design attention on both comfort and style—providing clients with chic, sophisticated interiors and products. Throughout the 70’s and early 80’s, Mr. Donghia’s client list grew to include a who’s who of celebrities and design stars, including Halston, Liza Minelli, Donald and Ivana Trump, Mary Tyler Moore, Calvin Klein, and Ralph Lauren. Many of Mr. Donghia’s installations and own homes, in New York, Connecticut, and Key West, were featured in countless magazines and have remained timely and timeless to this day. For his outstanding contributions to the American interiors and design industries, Mr. Donghia was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame in 1985. Angelo Donghia’s untimely death in 1985 was a great loss to all who knew and worked with him. Today, the Donghia companies continue to prosper and promote the tradition of comfortable, elegant, contemporary furnishings and accessories for the residential and contract community.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Donghia Club Chair Shell/Belaggio Collection","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","30"" Width x 36.5"" Depth x 34.5"" Height

New York, NY","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Ward Bennett Channel Back Leather Lounge Chairs

(1886 - 1962) 
Born in Prague, Frankl together with his fellow European Joseph Urban, was one of the pioneering Modern designers working in America before 1925, who laid the foundations of the American tradition of modern decoration. After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) End Side Tables by Paul Frankl

"30"" Edmond Casarella Bronze Abstract Sculpture","MR8993","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edmond Casarella 
Edmond Casarella (1920, New Jersey - 1996) was a printmaker, painter and sculptor. His particular innovation was the use of layered cardboard printing matrix, that could be carved like a woodcut, enabling the inexpensive creation of large-scale works. 
He studied at Cooper Union in New York, before being hired by Antony Velonis to print serigraphs at Creative Printmakers under the National Youth Administration. After army service, he took courses from 1949-1951 under the G.I. Bill at the Brooklyn Museum School. 
In 1951, he earned a Fulbright Fellowship which allowed him to travel to Europe, in particular Italy and Greece, where he furthered his studies in art. At the end of the 1950s he returned to the United States, having earned a Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 1956 he began teaching, starting with classes at the Brooklyn Museum graphic workshop. 
He went on to teach courses at Cooper Union, Art Students League, Finch College, and Hunter College, and held temporary teaching positions at Yale, Rutgers, Columbia, and Pratt Universities. 
In his later career, from the mid-1960s, he predominantly worked in sculpture. 
Casarella’s prints, paintings, and sculptures have been included in numerous exhibitions and galleries throughout the United States and Eastern Europe, and are included in many public collections.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edmond Casarella Cast Aluminum Sculpture

Postmodern Houston Architecture 
1991 

1400 Smith Street is a 691ft (211m) tall postmodern skyscraper located in downtown Houston, Texas, United States. The building has 50 floors and is the 11th tallest building in the city. Designed by architectural firm Lloyd Jones Brewer and Associates, the building was completed in 1983. The 1.2 million square foot office tower is situated on Houston`s six-mile pedestrian and retail tunnel system that links many of the city`s downtown towers. The tower is currently leased by Chevron as a major tenant. 

The building was the former headquarters of Enron, America`s largest natural gas company during the 1990s and infamous for its financial scandal in 2001. 1400 Smith Street was originally known as Four Allen Center prior to Enron relocating to Houston in 1985. Enron constructed a second, matching building across the street that is connected by circular skywalk prior to the bankruptcy. The building`s white crown was lit during the evening for several years, but it has not been lit on a regular basis since 2002

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Cesca Side Chair by Marcel Breuer

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Isamu Noguchi sought to make sculpture useful in everyday life, and his furniture and interior designs are an important part of this project. Noguchi most actively worked in this field during the 1940s, creating furniture and interiors that displayed the biomorphic imagery of his contemporary sculpture. After the Second World War Noguchi traveled to Japan, where in 1951 he created the first paper and bamboo Akari lamps. Noguchi continued to design new Akari models for the rest of his career.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Biomorphic Coffee Table Designed by Isamu Noguchi

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright.

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.

"Danish Drexel Profile Line Dining Table & Chairs Set SOLD","MR8444","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Drexel
Drexel Heritage began on November 10, 1903 when five enterprising men from Morganton, North Carolina started a small furniture factory. Built on a tract of land where the wagon track crossed the railroad, it became known as Drexel. Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the area had an abundance of virgin timber including chestnut, oak, poplar, maple and walnut. Within three years, the 26,600-square-foot plant had 30 employees and average production was 50 pieces of furniture per week. The first product of their labor was a solid-oak, three-piece suite including a bureau, washstand and bed. It cost $14.50 wholesale. Today, the company`s combined manufacturing and distribution facilities total 2.3 million square feet. 
During the 1930s, as a result of the Depression, Drexel Heritage recognized the need to move away from commodity furniture toward designing home furnishings to appeal to its customers. A 13-person sales force was established and the first furniture designers were brought on board. In 1937, Drexel became the first furniture manufacturer to advertise in national magazines. 
Throughout World War II, all Drexel plants remained open. Wartime production included 50,000 government desks, 15 million tent stakes and millions of square feet of marine plywood for boats. About 4,000 bedroom suites were made for government housing at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The piece that prompted the most company pride was a custom desk created for General Douglas Macarthur. 
In 1956, Drexel acquired the successful Heritage Furniture Company from High Point, North Carolina, which was founded in 1932 by Elliott Wood. The two companies operated as separate divisions until 1974, when Drexel Enterprises and Heritage Furniture Company became Drexel Heritage.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","John O. Van Koert
John O. Van Koert, a prominent New York designer who helped promote the fascination with Danish modern furnishings in the 1950`s. 
Mr. Van Koert designed silverware and furniture that helped to introduce modernist shapes. Born in Manitoba, Canada, he later moved to Milwaukee, where he studied at the University of Wisconsin to be a painter and sculptor and taught design in the art department. After World War II, he settled in New York as a jewelry designer for Harry Winston and branched out into industrial design. 
His flatware designs in silver for Towle were well known in the 50`s. One of them, ``Contour,`` a sleek Miro-like design, was chosen to represent modernism in ``Knife, Fork and Spoon,`` a 1951 traveling exhibition on the history of eating implements organized by the Walter Art Center of Minneapolis. 
In 1954, he was exhibition director of ``Design in Scandinavia,`` a show that traveled for three years, to venues including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; it helped introduce Scandinavian modern design to Americans. 
Mr. Van Koert`s furniture designs for Drexel, a North Carolina manufacturer, were presented in model rooms in department stores like Abraham & Straus, Macy`s and Bloomingdale`s. A 1956 installation of walnut furniture with rounded edges, silver-finished hardware and chartreuse upholstery was shown against purple, silver and electric-blue walls.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Danish Drexel ""Profile"" Line Dining Set

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Time Life Lounge Chair and Ottoman Set

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944. 
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Ward Bennett Armchair

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stylish pair of Edward Wormley Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(12) Thonet Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

"(4) Vintage GF Goodform Adjustable Aluminum Chairs","MR8215","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 

In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 

The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 

The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 

During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 

Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Vintage General Fireproofing Adjustable Aluminum Chair Model 2123

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 

His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edward Wormley for Dunbar Tambour Door Zebrawood Cabinet

The architect Gaetano Pesce was born in 1939 in La Spezia, Italy. He attended the school of Architecture of Venice from 1958 to 1963. He has lived in many European cities – Padua, Venice, London, Helsinki, Paris – and since 1980, in New York. His multidisciplinary work is present in the permanent collections of Museums in France, Finland, the United States, England, Portugal and Italy. Gaetano Pesce has been teaching for twenty-six years at the École d’Architecture de Strasbourg and has lectured in the most prominent Universities and Cultural Institutions around the world. He has worked in France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United States, Brazil and Belgium. Pesce’s works are often memorable for their ability to give an unexpected twist to favorite themes: the “diversified series”, the twin functionality of objects and architecture, the creative use of colour, the political dimension of the project, the theory and practice of the “poorly executed”, the use and development of synthetic materials, the theory of the “femininity” of architectural projects and the “culture of objects”.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Gaetano Pesce 543 Broadway Chair

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 
Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair Italian Leather Rosewood Lounge Chairs designed by Tobia Scarpa for Cassina

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Half Circle Sofa Couch

Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Desk

"Vintage Howard Miller George Nelson Cylinde Bubble Lamp","MR8197","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Howard Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Cylinder Bubble Lamp 
George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947

George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947. Howard Miller continued to sell the line throughout the late 1970`s after which they were discontinued. George Nelson never named the different lamp designs and they were simply given numbers by Howard Miller. A large Saucer lamp was simply sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-727"", a large Ball lamp was sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-725"". Howard Miller sold a variety of handy accessories for the lamps including a tripod base of satin chrome or brass-finished steel, swing arms, adjustable pulley fixture, etc. Also interesting to note is that all Bubble Lamps were available with criss-cross wire pattern except models H-725, H-726, H-727 and H-728. In order to get a criss-cross wire pattern from your dealer, you simply specified the order with ""CC"" after the lamp number. 

Howard Miller did not sell the lamps directly, rather outsourced the sales to ""Richards Morgenthau, Inc"" who handled their national sales. In the 1990`s Modernica reissued the ""Bubble Lamp"" line and ""named"" each individual Bubble Lamp design, for example Saucer, Ball, Criss-Cross, etc. The image on the top right was created by George Nelson Associates and was printed on most sales brochures of the Bubble lamps.

"6ft Vintage Herman Miller George Nelson Walnut Desk","MR8326","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","6ft Vintage Herman Miller George Nelson Wood Desk

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Eames Fiberglass Armchair On Wooden Rocker Base

Philippe Starck was born in Paris on 18th January 1949 the son of an aircraft designer, it is he who probably inspired the young Starck. Even at a very early age Starck showed enthusiasm for design. Starck lives and works in Paris. 
Much of his work produced in the 1980`s and 1990`s was influenced by fashion and novelty. Some as being `overdesigned` has even referred it to. In the 21st century his approach to design seems to have changed. 
Products designed by Starck can be seen on display in the collections of a number of European and American museums, among them the Brooklyn Museum in New York, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Museum of Design in London. Exhibitions of his work, either alone or in conjunction with that of other designers, have been held, among other places, in Paris, Marseille, Rome, Munich, Düsseldorf, Kyoto, Tokyo, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Italian Kartell Starck Philippe Ero[s] Armchair

Bill Stephens started at Knoll as an assistant prototype builder after his graduation from the Philadelphia Museum School of Art. He first tried to make a cane chair on a minimal frame without success. He then changed the seat to a plastic shell that, when connected to the frame, formed a total structure; with this design innovation, the 1305U chair was born. It was originally designed for installation at the Yale School of Architecture student center.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Knoll Bill Stephens Bent Wood Club Lounge Chairs

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","7ft Herman Miller George Nelson Desk Restored

"(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs","MR8049","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs

"Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Lounge Chair with Ottoman","MR8873","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Charles and Ray Eames

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Lounge Chair with Ottoman 
The Aluminum Group was originally designed for indoor and outdoor domestic use, and during its development was often referred to as the ""Leisure Group."" Aluminum Group chairs were originally developed in 1958 as a special project by Charles and Ray Eames for a private residence being designed by Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard. The seat-back suspension was a major technical achievement and represented a departure from the concept of the chair as a solid shell. 
One of the unique features of this Eames Aluminum Group Chair is the way the seat pad is held in place, stretched tautly around cylinders at either end of the chair frame, creating a ""sitting pocket"" that is both firm and flexible. 
This chair is a high-back tilt-swivel lounge chair with arms.

"Vintage Howard Miller George Nelson Melon Bubble Lamp","MR8201","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Howard Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Melon Bubble Lamp
George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947 


George Nelson created the ""Bubble Lamp"" line for Howard Miller in 1947. Howard Miller continued to sell the line throughout the late 1970`s after which they were discontinued. George Nelson never named the different lamp designs and they were simply given numbers by Howard Miller. A large Saucer lamp was simply sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-727"", a large Ball lamp was sold under ""Bubble Lamp H-725"". Howard Miller sold a variety of handy accessories for the lamps including a tripod base of satin chrome or brass-finished steel, swing arms, adjustable pulley fixture, etc. Also interesting to note is that all Bubble Lamps were available with criss-cross wire pattern except models H-725, H-726, H-727 and H-728. In order to get a criss-cross wire pattern from your dealer, you simply specified the order with ""CC"" after the lamp number. 

Howard Miller did not sell the lamps directly, rather outsourced the sales to ""Richards Morgenthau, Inc"" who handled their national sales. In the 1990`s Modernica reissued the ""Bubble Lamp"" line and ""named"" each individual Bubble Lamp design, for example Saucer, Ball, Criss-Cross, etc. The image on the top right was created by George Nelson Associates and was printed on most sales brochures of the Bubble lamps.

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Chrome Bar Stools

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","42"" Round Vintage Herman Miller Eames","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","42"" diameter and 28"" height.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good"

The Heywood-Wakefield company was based in Gardner, Mass. Their modern furniture line was produced from the 1930s through the 1960s. This line was extremely popular because of its sleek, streamlined style and is very sought after by collectors and those who simply want well-made solid birch wood furniture. The furniture, mostly made in champagne or wheat finishes, has its own classic style, almost shaker-like in its simplicity and is appreciated for its timeless good looks.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ernest Hermann

In 1992, Davis met Wolfgang Mezger when they licensed the Tao Desk Collection from Renz in Germany. This desk collection offered Davis their first clean contemporary desk line for the American market, and it is their best selling casegood line to date. 
From this initial relationship, Davis knew that Wolfgang’s attention to detail, design flair, and versatility in design would take their products into new directions. In 1998, Davis asked this talented designer to create a modular working lounge that would offer the customer a way to customize their lounge area. In 2000, the Palette Lounge Series was introduced, and grew in one year to be the second best selling product. The unique pallet construction allows designers to specify each component…from bench seat to arm seat…from glass table to tablet arm. The unit supports people working separately or together, as well as offers power and data connections.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(8) Davis Wolfgang Mezger Stacking Side Zeno Chair Set

"Wormley Edward Dining Drop-Leaf Table Chairs","MR8485","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Drexel 
Drexel Heritage began on November 10, 1903 when five enterprising men from Morganton, North Carolina started a small furniture factory. Built on a tract of land where the wagon track crossed the railroad, it became known as Drexel. Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the area had an abundance of virgin timber including chestnut, oak, poplar, maple and walnut. Within three years, the 26,600-square-foot plant had 30 employees and average production was 50 pieces of furniture per week. The first product of their labor was a solid-oak, three-piece suite including a bureau, washstand and bed. It cost $14.50 wholesale. Today, the company`s combined manufacturing and distribution facilities total 2.3 million square feet. 
During the 1930s, as a result of the Depression, Drexel Heritage recognized the need to move away from commodity furniture toward designing home furnishings to appeal to its customers. A 13-person sales force was established and the first furniture designers were brought on board. In 1937, Drexel became the first furniture manufacturer to advertise in national magazines. 
Throughout World War II, all Drexel plants remained open. Wartime production included 50,000 government desks, 15 million tent stakes and millions of square feet of marine plywood for boats. About 4,000 bedroom suites were made for government housing at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The piece that prompted the most company pride was a custom desk created for General Douglas Macarthur. 
In 1956, Drexel acquired the successful Heritage Furniture Company from High Point, North Carolina, which was founded in 1932 by Elliott Wood. The two companies operated as separate divisions until 1974, when Drexel Enterprises and Heritage Furniture Company became Drexel Heritage.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley
Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Drexel Precedent Series by Wormley Dining Drop-Leaf Table & Chairs Set

"Vintage General Fireproofing Executive Aluminum Chair","MR8208","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF)

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 

In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 

The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 

The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 

During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 

Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage General Fireproofing Executive Aluminum Chair Model 2157

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Drexel Precedent Series by Wormley Dining","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Unfolded: Length 70"" x Depth 50"" x Height 30""

Andreas Tuck, Denmark 

Andreas Tuck was one of the greatest Danish furniture design companies in the middle of the 20th century. Tuck produced design pieces that epitomize the ultimate in classic Danish craftsmanship - it is simple, functional and modest. Many of the ""Great Danes"" had their furniture designs produced by Andreas Tuck, perhaps most notably Hans J. Wegner who designed furniture for Andreas Tuck for a long range of years.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Hans Jørgen Wegner 
(April 2, 1914 - January 26, 2007) 
Hans J. Wegner must be considered as one of the most influential designers of the 20th century. Wegner has become a worldwide icon, particularly famous for his influence on Danish furniture design. Son of a shoe-maker in southern Jutland, Wegner began his long career at the age of 14. Over the years, he designed over 500 chairs with many different wood types and styles. His style is based on clean, simple lines and to Wegner a chair was an artwork as much as a functional object. One of his well-known philosophies was that a chair should be beautiful from every angle and that it should not have a backside. Though Wegner designed for series production, all of his work bears the stamp of the traditionally trained craftsman. Wegner`s most famous chairs are the ""Peacock"", the ""Y-chair"", and ""The Chair"" which was used by Kennedy and Nixon in their famous CBS TV debate of 1960. Most of his designs were produced by Johannes Hansen, Fritz Hansen or PP Möbler, some of which are still in production today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Wegner for Andreas Tuck Danish Dining Table AT-303

October 17, 1905-November 1, 1977 

Franco Albini italian Neo-Rationalist architect and designer. A native of Robbiate, near Milan, Albini obtained his degree in architecture at Politecnico di Milano University in 1929 and began his professional career working for Gio Ponti. He started displaying his works at Milan Triennale. In 1930 he opened his own practice. 
Through his creations, the modern furniture design merged the Italian traditional artisanship with the new forms of modernism. In his creations, he used raw, inexpensive materials. He exploited the very skilled Italian craftsmanship. This also meant an elegant design based on minimalist aesthetics, mixed with extraneous ornamentations. 
One of the first, successful works in 1939 concerned a radio, which was made of glass, so to show its internal components. 
In 1950 Magistretti designed the famous and fashionable ""Margherita"" and ""Gala"" chairs, made of woven cane. In 1952 he created the ""Fiorenza"" armchair for Arflex; in 1955 the ""Luisa"" chair; in 1956 the ""Rocking chaise"" for Poggi. 
In the 1960s he worked on industrial design as well as important architectural projects. In 1961 he designed the Rome Rinascente building. Three years later he designed in a team of experts many Milan subway stations. In 1964 the television set he created for Brionvega was displayed at the Milan Triennial. In the same year, he created various lamps for Arteluce. 
Franco Albini, among other companies, worked for: Brionvega, Cassina, Arflex, Arteluce and Poggi. 
Albini was also an architect & interior designer. Among the others, in 1945 he created the `Zanini Fur Shop` located in Milan. As writer and editor, from 1945 to 1946 he worked for the Italian magazine Casabella. 
Albini obtained three Compasso d`Oro awards, the most prestigious Italian design prize.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Franco Albini Stool Ottoman Mid Century Modern

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Flat Bar Side Chair

Tobia Scarpa was the son of famous architect Carlo Scarpa. He attended the Instituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice and began his career designing glassworks and lamps. Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. 

Many of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their ""Bastiano"" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the ""Coronado"" series of armchairs and the ""Soriana"" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","80"" Modern Knoll Scarpa Andre Dining Table Glass Chrome

"7ft Vintage Milo Baughman Black Sofa Couch","MR8341","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Milo Baughman 
Milo Baughman (1925-) is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success. 
In the late 1940`s Ed Frank of the influential Frank Bros. store in Long Beach, California hired Baughman to do sales, window display and interior design. Baughman came fresh from designing officer’s clubs during World War II and, as Frank recalls, “he had imagination like crazy,” which must have had few outlets in the conservative atmosphere of wartime design. While at Frank Bros., Baughman also became involved in the publication of Furniture Forum with Georgia Christensen. This compendium showcased all things modern, from furniture to floor and wall coverings to tableware. It was one of the first American publications to provide a picture of the designers and a brief blurb about their accomplishments to date as well as dimensions and pricing. Furniture Forum was an invaluable resource to design firms worldwide and remains an important historical record.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","7ft Vintage Black Sofa Chrome Legs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","85"" Width x 31"" Depth x 30"" Height

"Vintage Walnut Jens Risom Settee Sofa Couch Lounge Seating SOLD","MR8101","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Jens Risom Design Inc.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Walnut Jens Risom Settee Lounge Seating

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Jens Risom Walnut Slipper Club Chairs

These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 
In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced.

"Gilbert Rohde Herman Miller Lounge Easy Chair No 3950 ~Reduced Price!!! Original Price Was $5,900","MR8583","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gilbert Rohde 
American, 1894-1944 

It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. Then he met D. J. DePree. DePree also had a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. `This calls for a different kind of furniture,` he said. 
Could Rohde design such furniture, DePree asked? Yes. Would he design such furniture for Herman Miller? Yes. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You`re not making furniture anymore,` Rohde told DePree. `You`re providing a way of life.` 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (`rotorettes`) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place and a radical departure from the standard living or dining room `suites` purchased at the time. 
And with the introduction of Rohde`s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market. 
Rohde`s groundbreaking designs, however, were not an easy sell to mainstream retailers unschooled in the new design concepts. Their lack of understanding led to another of Rohde`s revolutionary ideas: the manufacturer`s showroom, which he transformed into a centre where knowledgeable representatives could talk about furniture they understood and appreciated. 
A true innovator and pioneer, Gilbert Rohde set the stage for those who followed him at Herman Miller in the 40s and 50s, including George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames. It was Rohde who took Herman Miller into the world of modern design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Reduced Price!!!!

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","8ft Herman Miller Eames Conference Table

"56"" Herman Miller Nelson Platform Bench","MR8662","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","56"" Herman Miller Nelson Platform Bench 

Introduced in 1946, the Nelson platform bench remains a landmark of modern design. The clean, rectilinear lines reflect designer George Nelson`s architectural background and his insistence on what he called ""honest"" design - making an honest visual statement about an object`s purpose. The bench serves as a multipurpose display and resting place in offices, public areas, and homes.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. Herman Miller recently acquired the company","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Ward Bennett Brickel Cane Carved Side Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Flat Bar Side Chair

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Ward Bennett Leather Arm Chairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","6ft Herman Miller Eames Conference Table

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller Pedestal Side Table

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Executive Roll Top Desk by Edward Wormley for Dunbar

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(12) Thonet Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

"Jens Risom Dining Table & Knoll Cafiero Chairs Set","MR8520","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Table >Jens Risom Design Inc.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Table >Jens Risom 
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Jens Risom Dining Table &","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Chairs:

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 
The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 
Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick.

Berne Indiana","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley
Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edward Wormley Armchair for Dunbar

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Price Reduced!!!","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","26.5"" Width x 26"" Depth x 34.5"" Height

"Herman Miller Paldao Burl End Table by Gilbert Rohde","MR8581","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Gilbert Rohde 
(American, 1894-1944) 
Designer Gilbert Rohde was born and raised in New York, the son of a cabinetmaker. He left high school to pursue a variety of jobs, landing a short stint at a local paper, the Bronx News, drawing political cartoons. In 1923 he turned the experience into a job as an illustrator at the Abraham & Strauss department store. Inspired by a trip to the Paris Exhibition in 1925, Rohde began designing furniture and his early work was sold at Lord & Taylor. An exuberant modernist, his pieces gleaned simplicity and rationalism from Bauhaus design and a sense of form and ornamentation from Art Deco. He worked predominantly in Bakelite and chrome, the materials that made up the visual vocabulary of the period. 
Between 1927-28 Rohde designed the interiors for Avedon fashion stores, where his wife was part of the advertising team. Heywood-Wakefield of Massachusetts began picking up his designs in 1930, with a bentwood chair being one of their most successful pieces. Restless for a more substantial opportunity, he went west to Grand Rapids, Michigan where companies like John Widdicomb and Herman Miller had turned the city into a hub of furniture design and manufacturing. Rohde attracted the interest of Herman Miller and began designing for them in 1931. The company had been making traditional pieces and historical reproductions and was close to bankruptcy when they accepted Rohde`s modern work in a last ditch attempt to stay afloat. Apparently the miracle they needed, Rohde convinced them that modernism was the reigning style and proved it with his designs for bedroom furniture shown at the 1933 Chicago World`s Fair. Fortified by their updated image, Herman Miller had Rohde design entire sets for living and dining rooms and began making plans to halt their production of traditional pieces. Rohde designed a popular line of modular office furniture for Herman Miller, and they would later reintroduce the bentwood chair he made for Heywood-Wakefield. He also acted as the Design Director for several years.
During his tenure with Herman Miller Rohde was also pursuing a number of outside projects. He made a line of chrome chairs for the Troy Sunshade Company in 1933 and also worked some with Thonet. His designs were exhibited at the show of Machine Art at the MoMA in 1934 as well as at the Art and Industry show inside New York`s RCA building. In 1939 he exhibited work at the New York World`s Fair. He acted as the director of the Design Laboratory, also in New York, from 1935-38, and was the head of industrial design at the NYU School of Architecture from 1939-43.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Paldao Burl End Table by Gilbert Rohde

(1886 - 1962) 
Born in Prague, Frankl together with his fellow European Joseph Urban, was one of the pioneering Modern designers working in America before 1925, who laid the foundations of the American tradition of modern decoration. After spending some time in Berlin and Copenhagen, Frankl left for America in 1914 and set up in business in New York. Although at first describing himself as an architect, in 1922 he opened a gallery at 4e, 48th Street which sold a variety of his designs for furniture, as well as modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe, His influence as a designer was compounded by his polemical pro-Modern publications: New Dimensions, Form and Re-Form, Machine Age Leisure, Spaces for Living, and Survey of American Textiles. In 1926 he introduced his celebrated skyscraper furniture, before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","6ft Vintage Paul Frankl Cork Top Coffee Table Bench

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum

John O. Van Koert, a prominent New York designer who helped promote the fascination with Danish modern furnishings in the 1950`s. 
Mr. Van Koert designed silverware and furniture that helped to introduce modernist shapes. Born in Manitoba, Canada, he later moved to Milwaukee, where he studied at the University of Wisconsin to be a painter and sculptor and taught design in the art department. After World War II, he settled in New York as a jewelry designer for Harry Winston and branched out into industrial design. 
His flatware designs in silver for Towle were well known in the 50`s. One of them, ``Contour,`` a sleek Miro-like design, was chosen to represent modernism in ``Knife, Fork and Spoon,`` a 1951 traveling exhibition on the history of eating implements organized by the Walter Art Center of Minneapolis. 
In 1954, he was exhibition director of ``Design in Scandinavia,`` a show that traveled for three years, to venues including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; it helped introduce Scandinavian modern design to Americans. 
Mr. Van Koert`s furniture designs for Drexel, a North Carolina manufacturer, were presented in model rooms in department stores like Abraham & Straus, Macy`s and Bloomingdale`s. A 1956 installation of walnut furniture with rounded edges, silver-finished hardware and chartreuse upholstery was shown against purple, silver and electric-blue walls.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(6) Danish Drexel ""Profile"" Line Dining Chairs Set

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Mies Van der Rohe Brno Chair

"(2) Vintage Jens Risom Lounge Arm Chairs Leather Walnut SOLD","MR8099","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Jens Risom Lounge Chairs Leather Walnut

"6ft Herman Miller George Nelson Walnut Low Credenza","MR8324","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Low Credenza Walnut with Black Lacquer Doors

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller George Nelson Steel Frame Two Tier Night Stand End Table

"Three Piece Set Tomlinson Sectional Circa 1950","MR8496","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Furniture by Tomlinson 
Sidney Halstead Tomlinson, Sr. co-founded The Tomlinson Chair Manufacturing Co. with his brother in 1901. He started with 12 employees. 
The story of Tomlinson / Erwin - Lambeth began over one hundred years ago with two different companies only eight miles apart. Both companies were family owned and operated and began within months of each other. The Tomlinson family started the Tomlinson Chair Company in High Point, North Carolina in 1901. 

Also in 1901, the Lambeth family started The Standard Chair Company in Thomasville, North Carolina. In 1947, a new plant was built to create furniture specifically for the design trade. 
Tomlinson was one of the first manufacturers to make matched dining room suites and to develop period adaptations in the 19th Century French, English and American styles. In order to show their product to its best advantage, Tomlinson devised displays in gallery form, starting a marketing trend that is still widely used today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Three Piece Tomlinson Sectional

"4ft Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Propst HOLD","MR8536","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson
George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.
In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 
Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4ft Herman Miller George Nelson Action Office Robert Propst

"Vintage GF ""Goodform"" Model 4304 Aluminum Side Chair Sold","MR8210","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company (GF) 

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 

In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 

The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 

The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 

During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 

Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage GF ""Goodform"" Model 4304 Side Chairs

Warren McArthur(1885-1961), whose furniture helped define the glamour of 1930s Art Deco curves, grew up in an environment steeped in support for the advancements of the new age of technology and design. Raised in Chicago, his father was one of the first locals to own a car, and, in 1892, hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design their house. When McArthur moved to Arizona to form what would be a series of business ventures introducing modern aesthetics and philosophies to the Phoenix area, his father funded almost every project. With this support, both financial and inspirational, McArthur was able to create a sizable catalogue of furniture and a number of technological innovations in aluminum furniture production.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","20% OFF SALE!!

"(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs","MR8052","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Jens Risom

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Mid Century Modern Jens Risom Wood Arm Chairs

American, 1894-1944 
It was 1930, and Gilbert Rohde had a problem: he was full of fresh new ideas about furniture design but he couldn`t convince any of the traditional manufacturers to take them on. Then he met D. J. DePree. DePree also had a problem: his company, Herman Miller, needed a major shot in the arm if it was going to survive. 
Rohde told DePree that his new ideas made sense for the changing times and for the growing number of people who were living in apartments and smaller houses. `This calls for a different kind of furniture,` he said. 
Could Rohde design such furniture, DePree asked? Yes. Would he design such furniture for Herman Miller? Yes. 
A deal was struck, and thus began a relationship that would lead Herman Miller into an exciting and challenging new era. `You`re not making furniture anymore,` Rohde told DePree. `You`re providing a way of life.` 
Disdaining ornamentation that often covered up shoddy workmanship, Rohde espoused clean, simple, honest designs. To accommodate smaller living spaces, he created furniture with dual purposes: a card table that turned into a dining table, a settee that folded back into a bed, tables (`rotorettes`) that housed books and other items on rotating shelves. He loved this idea of interchangeability, demonstrated most notably in his Living-Dining Group - individual pieces that could go in either place and a radical departure from the standard living or dining room `suites` purchased at the time. 
And with the introduction of Rohde`s Executive Office Group, the company entered the office furniture market. 
Rohde`s groundbreaking designs, however, were not an easy sell to mainstream retailers unschooled in the new design concepts. Their lack of understanding led to another of Rohde`s revolutionary ideas: the manufacturer`s showroom, which he transformed into a centre where knowled geable representatives could talk about furniture they understood and appreciated. 
A true innovator and pioneer, Gilbert Rohde set the stage for those who followed him at Herman Miller in the 40s and 50s, including George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames. It was Rohde who took Herman Miller into the world of modern design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Reduced Price; Original Price Was $8,500","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","34"" Length x 17"" Radius x 22.5"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good vintage.

Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

"9ft Vintage Michael Taylor Wood Satin Sofa Couch","MR8921","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Michael Taylor 
Many influential decorators have worked in a signature style, but few contributed as many enduring influential furnishings to the design market as did Michael Taylor. His interiors appeared in every major magazine from the beginning of his career in the 1950`s to, quite literally, the end. Michael was the designer`s designer. His sense of scale was wonderment unequalled. He deplored the copyists - those who fed on his originality. 
Consistently denouncing the cluttered and pretentious, he had a simple ethos: when you take something out, you must increase the size of what`s left. The inventor of what has come to be known as the California Look, he became famous for white-walled, light-filled rooms with boldly over scaled furniture and decorative accessories. Taylor fans recognize his work to be pure and simple but by no means plain - a combination of rusticity and glamour. 
More than a decade after his death, Taylor`s reputation as an innovator in the world of home design glows undiminished. "" You can look at a picture of a room he designed in 1953, and it still looks wonderful today"", notes New York designer Albert Hadley. 

Paul J. Weaver, former Vice President of McGuire and an expert in marketing, collaborated with Taylor to set the cornerstone of a collection meticulously edited for today`s consumer at the top. Weaver, a highly visible spokesman for the company, has succeeded in identifying and further establishing the work upon which Taylor`s claim of importance and legacy are founded. ""In a market where the signature of an established tastemaker wields considerable influence"", says Weaver, ""Michael Taylor`s name speaks to the most discerning consumers in the market - the ones for whom the authority of quality, confidence, and style matter most"".

Joseph Hoffmann (1870-1956) 

Josef Hoffmann was born in 1870, in the Moravian town of Pirnitz (Brtnice), in today’s Czech Republic. He studied architecture under Carl von Hasenauer and Otto Wagner at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. In 1899, at the age of 29, he became a professor at what is now the University of Applied Arts Vienna. In 1903 he and Kolo Moser established the Wiener Werkstätte, an association of artists and artisans whose aim was to find a market for modern, functional everyday objects of the highest quality and craftsmanship. Working with the Wiener Werkstätte Hoffmann designed a wide range of furnishings and pioneering exhibitions in Vienna as well as other cities including Cologne and Paris. His first important building, the sanatorium in Purkersdorf, near Vienna, built in 1904, set radical new standards in architecture and interior design, and earned its creator international acclaim. But it was the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, built between 1905 and 1911, that founded his international reputation. Here, Josef Hoffmann succeeded in perfecting the Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art), reconciling art and life, and aestheticizing all aspects of design. 
Recurring motifs are apparent in Josef Hoffmann’s formal language. Initially, the dominant themes were strict geometrical lines, and a search for simplicity and clarity. The reduction to black and white was typical. From furniture to architectural façades, Hoffmann varied the multiple framing of surfaces. Later he increasingly became a virtuoso in the use of the finest materials and of light, and the dramatic treatment of space. The free development of classical motifs such as vertical channeling or his horizontal wave-shaped profiling shows Hoffmann’s creative talent and ability to create totally innovative compositions starting out from existing formal canons. 
Josef Hoffmann was never the kind of architect to theorize, still less write about his ideas. He avoided and argued against excessive explaining and too many words. But his works, his relationships with clients and patrons, and his ability to create an entirely new aesthetic while respecting the past all made him popular and successful in the best sense, as he remains today. Hoffmann’s inexhaustible creativity, his feel for elegance and sensuality, and his constantly surprising reinterpretations of classic stylistic features produced an oeuvre that can not only be described as profoundly Austrian but also continues to delight us with its beauty and harmony. 
Josef Hoffmann overcame the duality of tradition and modernity. His sensual and extremely elegant designs are modern and yet welcoming. They are redolent of a past richness and an artistic ideal. This timeless quality remains an inspiration and defining influence for the Wittmann Workshops. 
Josef Hoffmann died in Vienna in 1956.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Josef Hoffmann for Wittmann Haus Koller Chairs

"5ft Mid Century Modern Edward Wormley Dunbar Desk","MR8852","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Dunbar","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edward Wormley

Wormley has pioneered in a broad field of design, he was one of those unique designers who was sensitive to the interplay involved in selling modernism and still preserving the nostalgic touch of intimacy, warmth and detail. Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. 
His first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Dunbar Edward Wormley Desk

Taking his cue from the Swedish craft tradition, his popular wooden furniture explored organic, even anthropomorphic shapes. His buildings were recognized for their extensive and innovative use of glass walls and aesthetic coexistence with their environment. He possessed a modernist openness towards emerging technologies, viewing them as acceptable means to making high quality furnishings and expanding the notions of design and production. Mathsson also, like Kaare Klint, studied what he called ""the business of sitting"" in relation to the structures of modern furniture in order to make pieces that were customized to their function. He wrote that, ""comfortable sitting is an `art`-- it ought not to be. Instead, the making of chairs has to be done with such an `art` that the sitting will not be any `art.`""His work was shown in a one-man exhibition at the Röhsska Art & Craft Museum on Gothenburg in 1936 and he started to build an international reputation with his pieces at the World Fair in Paris a year later. His work shown at the MoMA in 1939 represented some of the first pieces of furniture ever exhibited by the museum.From 1945 until 1958 he turned much of his attention to architecture. In 1958 he collaborated with Piet Hein on furniture designs and new production techniques. Mathsson began experimenting with the creation of tubular steel furniture in the 1960s. He designed the ""Jetson"" chair, upholstered in cloth, and the leather-covered ""Karin"" chair. In 1955 he was awarded the Gregor Paulsson Medal in Stockholm, and he continued to exhibit work internationally until the early 1980s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Mid Century Modern Knoll International Coffee Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","60"" Length x 24"" Width x 19"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent refinished"
