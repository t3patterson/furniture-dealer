"4 Vintage Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe MR10 Tubular Side Chairs PRICE REDUCED","MR10","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Knoll International","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ludwig Mies van der RoheMies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","4 Vintage Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe MR10 Tubular Side Chairs Throughout the 1920s the German architect Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969) collaborated with the interior designer Lilly Reich (1885-1947) on the development of furniture for his architectural projects. By the mid-1920s they, like other progressive designers, were fascinated by the possibilities of tubular metal. Mies and Reich were intrigued by the cantilever chair, which they saw as the acme of modernity offering the comfort of a conventional armchair without the bourgeois associations of upholstery. By 1927, they had developed the textile-seated MR10 and cane-seated MR20. Both chairs were exhibited at the 1927 Die Wohnung exhibition of modern living at the Weissenhof Settlement in Stuttgart.

Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Jens Risom Double Pedestal Walnut Desk

Russel Wright first began at the age of 30 to design 60 pieces of furniture for Heywood-Wakefield Furniture Company. These items were sold at Bloomingdale`s and were marketed with rugs, curtains, lamps and accessories all designed by Russel Wright. This was 1934 and marked the first offering of coordinated mass produced home furnishings ever created by 1 designer. 

In 1935 Russel Wright contracted with Conant Ball Company to produce American Modern. A solid maple line of furniture, it was an instant hit. It was offered in 2 finishes, a natural unstained finish Russel and Mary dubbed blonde and a reddish stained maple. This line was the first solid maple, blonde finished furniture of modern design ever to be produced. 

A vice president of Macy`s said in 1938, that this line was the most successful ever carried by Macy`s, whether traditional or modern.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Russel Wright Modernmates Conant Ball Birch Side Table Nightstand

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Van Der Rohe Brno Chairs

The first and still the most elegant of its kind, the Brno Chair by Mies van der Rohe is a masterpiece of structure. Designed in 1930 for the Tugendhat House in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Brilliance of form and function shown in the construction of these chairs represents the beginnings of an intensely creative period in architecture known as the ""Bauhaus"" period.

"31"" Edmond Casarella Soaring Sculpture ( abn72 )","MR11627","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Edmond Casarella 
Edmond Casarella (1920, New Jersey - 1996) was a printmaker, painter and sculptor. His particular innovation was the use of layered cardboard printing matrix, that could be carved like a woodcut, enabling the inexpensive creation of large-scale works. 
He studied at Cooper Union in New York, before being hired by Antony Velonis to print serigraphs at Creative Printmakers under the National Youth Administration. After army service, he took courses from 1949-1951 under the G.I. Bill at the Brooklyn Museum School. 
In 1951, he earned a Fulbright Fellowship which allowed him to travel to Europe, in particular Italy and Greece, where he furthered his studies in art. At the end of the 1950s he returned to the United States, having earned a Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 1956 he began teaching, starting with classes at the Brooklyn Museum graphic workshop. 
He went on to teach courses at Cooper Union, Art Students League, Finch College, and Hunter College, and held temporary teaching positions at Yale, Rutgers, Columbia, and Pratt Universities. 
In his later career, from the mid-1960s, he predominantly worked in sculpture. 
Casarella’s prints, paintings, and sculptures have been included in numerous exhibitions and galleries throughout the United States and Eastern Europe, and are included in many public collections.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Edmond Casarella ""Soaring"" Sculpture","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","13"" Depth 14"" Width 31"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage"

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Blue Vintage Herman Miller Eames Fiberglass Side Shell","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18.5"" Width 22"" Depth 31.5"" Height, 17.5"" Seat Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage

The world`s most singular, severely elegant collection of contemporary furniture has been created by Nicos Zographos. He has produced more than 300 kinds of products for thousands of spaces in America and Europe. Zographos is the last adherent to the strict aesthetic principles first defined by the European Bauhaus school, and he is very likely one of the last designers to manage his own manufacturing company. Within a business bounded by commercial constraints, his enduring values have significantly influenced both the style and the standards of the modern furniture industry.

TRANSFORMATION As early as 1910, DUNBAR had established a reputation for providing the ultimate in quality handcrafted products to America’s most discriminating clientele. The original custom DUNBAR creations were the finest buggies and horse drawn carriages for the gentry class. With the introduction of the automobile, DUNBAR wisely transformed into one of America’s premier fine furnishings companies. 

WORMLEY In 1931, destiny brought Edward J Wormley, a young twenty three year old furniture designer with a fresh new perspective, to the doors of DUNBAR. A gifted designer and student of furniture history, Wormley inspired a global perspective and was instrumental in the introduction of world-class design philosophies into the American interior landscape. With a passion for quality and an eye for detail, Wormley found a perfect partner for his talent in DUNBAR, and remained with the company as Design Director for over three decades. 

THE DUNBAR ERA During the middle of the 20th century, DUNBAR and Edward J Wormley became true icons in American design and furniture history. In 1950, The Chicago Merchandise Mart joined with the Museum of Modern Art to sponsor the GOOD DESIGN exhibition. The annual exhibition, designed to commend selected home furnishings for their “excellent appearance and progressive performance,” was often a platform of recognition for DUNBAR. Over a three year period, Wormley’s creations for DUNBAR dominated the exhibition with an astonishing thirty unique designs receiving GOOD DESIGN designations. 

THE LEGACY Today, DUNBAR Furniture continues the legacy of design integrity and innovation. Our focus remains on providing custom specified handcrafted furnishings designed by Edward J Wormley. The introduction of new designs from exciting International designers is also on the horizon. DUNBAR Furniture is now part of the 21st century with the mission of providing timeless designs to an International audience.","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","58""W x 24""D x 29""H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very good"

"New Humanscale Freedom  Task Chair HOLD ( abo44 )","MR11219","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Humanscale 

Humanscale made its first significant mark as an innovation pioneer in the late 1990s with the introduction of high-performance articulating keyboard systems, which offer effortless one-touch adjustability while eliminating the knee-clearance issues associated with competing solutions. Today the company is the runaway leader in that product category. But it was Humanscale’s entry into the task seating market that truly turned heads. 

In 1999, Humanscale took the contract furniture industry by storm with the introduction of the Freedom chair, designed by ergonomics pioneer Niels Diffrient. The revolutionary seating solution broke new ground by combining unprecedented functionality with minimal manual controls, utilizing dynamic mechanisms that respond to the requirements of each individual user automatically. In 2009, Humanscale sold its millionth Freedom chair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Humanscale Freedom Task Chair 

The Humanscale Freedom Chair is designed to give the maximum ergonomic benefit to the sitter with a minimum number of manually-adjusted controls. Once the Humanscale Freedom Chair is fitted, no further adjustment is required. The idea is that movement, which is essential for a healthy body, shouldn’t be constricted by locking mechanisms and manual controls. In other words, sitting comfortably isn’t something you should have to think about.

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 

The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 

Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick.

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible

Italian, 1918-2006 
Mimmo Rotella was born in Catanzaro, Italy, on October 7, 1918 and currently lives in Milan. He is considered a leading artist of the twentieth century, having pioneered the use of advertising and cinema posters in collages that expressed both the modern, urban condition and a crisis in art. Rotella began in the 1950s by ripping posters off the street and then reapplying them to canvas. Later, in the 1960s, he developed a method of serial production by projecting negatives of his images onto an emulsified canvas so that they essentially became mechanically reproduced. In subsequent years, he has furthered his experiments, applying blank sheets of paper onto advertising posters and layering images on top, for example, or incorporating the use of graffiti. 

In 1992, Rotella was conferred the title of Officiel des arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, and in 2002, he was conferred the Gold Medal for visual arts by the Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Zerodisegno Rotella Marilyn Console Table","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","53"" W 18"" D 36"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Showroom Sample"

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Alvar Aalto Artek Stackable Bentwood Side Table Stools

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","81"" Vintage Jens Risom Walnut Desk

Bill Stephens started at Knoll as an assistant prototype builder after his graduation from the Philadelphia Museum School of Art. He first tried to make a cane chair on a minimal frame without success. He then changed the seat to a plastic shell that, when connected to the frame, formed a total structure; with this design innovation, the 1305U chair was born.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Saarinen began his career as a student at Yale University and after travels and studies in Europe returned to the U.S. and taught for a brief period at Cranbrook. Cranbrook was founded by publisher George C. Booth and Eliel Saarinen in 1927 and Saarinen became Director in 1932. Two of its graduates were Charles Eames and Florence Schust Knoll. Saarinen and Eames collaborated on various projects, culminating in a range of furniture that won first prize at an exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1940 entitled, ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings."" After 1946, however Eames went to work for Herman Miller; Saarinen became associated with Knoll Associates.

"Herman Miller Geoff Hollington Relay Credenza ( abo43 )","MR11255","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller 

Herman Miller, Inc., based in Zeeland, Michigan, is a major American manufacturer of office furniture and equipment, as well as furniture for the home. It is notable as one of the first companies to produce modern furniture and, under the guidance of Design Director George Nelson, is likely the most prolific and influential producer of furniture of the modernist style. Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the ""Action Office II"") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst.Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Geoff Hollington 

Hollington studied design at the Royal College of Art in London in the early 1970s and shortly afterward ""discovered"" Herman Miller and the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames. ""If you asked me, way back, what`s the one company in the world I`d really like to work for, it would have been Herman Miller,"" he says. 
His hands come up to carve a rectangle out of the air as he describes the designer`s challenge of creating a humane environment for work. ""In the 1960s and 1970s, we tended to think of offices as factories or laboratories. We`re moving into a time when we think of offices as places where we can be creative."" 
It is this approach to design that makes his designs as appropriate for 
the home as for the office.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","71"" Herman Miller Relay Credenza

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Milo Baughman Buffet Cabinet for Thayer Coggin

From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Ward Bennett Italian Leather Arm Chairs

John Widdicomb","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings 

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchieres whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","USA","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","91"" W x 34"" D x 29"" H

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/cgi-bin/%60http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg%60","(12) Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chairs

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material.

Throughout the 1920s the German architect Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969) collaborated with the interior designer Lilly Reich (1885-1947) on the development of furniture for his architectural projects. By the mid-1920s they, like other progressive designers, were fascinated by the possibilities of tubular metal. Mies and Reich were intrigued by the cantilever chair, which they saw as the acme of modernity offering the comfort of a conventional armchair without the bourgeois associations of upholstery. By 1927, they had developed the textile-seated MR10 and cane-seated MR20. Both chairs were exhibited at the 1927 Die Wohnung exhibition of modern living at the Weissenhof Settlement in Stuttgart.

Paul T. Frankl (1886–1958), an Art Deco furniture designer and maker, architect, painter and writer from Vienna, Austria, was the son of a wealthy real estate speculator. After Frankl completed his architectural studies at the Berlin Polytechnic, he traveled, spending time in Berlin and Copenhagen before arriving in the United States in April 1914. He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Chest of Drawers Dresser with Smooth and Combed Oak by Paul Frankl -1940s

John Widdicomb","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings 

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchieres whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage T.H.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Bertoia Brown Side Chair Cushion

By the 1930s she had settled in Glendale, CA where she produced complete sets of table ensembles which were sold at Marshall Fields in Chicago and other stores in the U.S. Thorpe was a designer, not a manufacturer, of glassware. She purchased ‘blanks’ from manufacturers, probably from Germany and Sweden, then decorated them with her personal designs. In 1945, Thorpe wrote to a collector that many of her floral motifs including eucalyptus, irises, roses, and narcissus flowers, were inspired by the flora and fauna that surrounded her on trips during her stay in Hawaii.

Throughout the 1920s the German architect Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969) collaborated with the interior designer Lilly Reich (1885-1947) on the development of furniture for his architectural projects. By the mid-1920s they, like other progressive designers, were fascinated by the possibilities of tubular metal. Mies and Reich were intrigued by the cantilever chair, which they saw as the acme of modernity offering the comfort of a conventional armchair without the bourgeois associations of upholstery. By 1927, they had developed the textile-seated MR10 and cane-seated MR20. Both chairs were exhibited at the 1927 Die Wohnung exhibition of modern living at the Weissenhof Settlement in Stuttgart.

( Denmark , 1916 )
Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 
Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 
Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 
In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Design year: 1950","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","32” high x 22.5” wide x 24” deep

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchieres and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchieres whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Mid Century T.H.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Original Bertoia Full Diamond Chair Cushion Pink and Brown Pattern

For over 70 years, Knoll has used modern design to connect people with their work, lives, and world.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Florence Knoll 

In 1938, Hans Knoll founded his furniture company by that na.e in New York. In 1943, Florence Schust convinced Hans she could help bring in business to his company even in America`s wartime economy by expanding into interior design by working with architects. With her architectural background and design flair, she succeeded. They married in 1946, she became a full business partner and together they founded Knoll Associates. A new furniture factory was established in Pennsylvania and dealers in Knoll`s furniture were carefully added over the next several years. 

Florence Knoll felt architects should contribute their design ability to furniture as well. Some of these furniture designs would become design icons of the 20th century and have remained in the Knoll line for decades due to their timeless design. When Hans Knoll died in a car accident in 1955, Florence Knoll took over operation of the company. Florence Knoll herself designed chairs, sofas, tables and casegoods during the 1950s, many of which remain in the Knoll line to this day. In 1958 she married Harry Hood Bassett.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Florence Knoll Pattern Sofa 

Florence Knoll Bassett took a holistic view of interior space planning. As director of the Knoll Planning Unit in the 1950s, her ""total design"" approach embraced everything about a space – including the furniture. She modestly referred to her furniture designs as the ""meat and potatoes"" of an interior, yet to this day they hold the same iconic American appeal as that most basic and functional of meals. Her Lounge Collection .1954. has the simple, architectural lines and unparalleled construction of all modern classics. This Sofa is manufactured by Knoll® according to the original and exacting specifications of the designer.

After Frankl completed his architectural studies at the Berlin Polytechnic, he traveled, spending time in Berlin and Copenhagen before arriving in the United States in April 1914. He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture.

Born and raised in Sweden, Folke Ohlsson moved to the United States in 1953 and established DUX, Inc. in San Francisco the same year. Six years later, Ohlsson moved the company to Burlingame, California. He received world-wide acclaim for his furniture designs which are generally referred to as “Scandinavian Modern” but often get categorized as “Danish Modern” or “Danish Teak”. Ohlsson’s designs blend graceful details of traditional style with the simplicity and good proportions of contemporary style.
 

Ohlsson received more than 30 awards including the Triennale Exhibit in Milan and the Good Design Show of the New York Museum of Modern Art. He lead the operation that has given DUX furniture its international distinction. In addition, his timely, but timeless designs are some of the world’s most copied. A patented, knockdown armchair, has been widely copied and mass-produced by more than 100 furniture designers.
 

Folke Ohlsson made a significant contribution to the widespread acceptance and tremendous popularity in the United States of modern Scandinavian furniture design.

Paul T. Frankl (1886–1958), an Art Deco furniture designer and maker, architect, painter and writer from Vienna, Austria, was the son of a wealthy real estate speculator. After Frankl completed his architectural studies at the Berlin Polytechnic, he traveled, spending time in Berlin and Copenhagen before arriving in the United States in April 1914. He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Night Stands with Smooth and Combed Oak by Paul Frankl -1940s

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944 
Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum

Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 

The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 

Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 

Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 

Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 

After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus.

Herman Miller, Inc., based in Zeeland, Michigan, is a major American manufacturer of office furniture and equipment, as well as furniture for the home. It is notable as one of the first companies to produce modern furniture and, under the guidance of Design Director George Nelson, is likely the most prolific and influential producer of furniture of the modernist style. Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the ""Action Office II"") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst.[1][2] Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Geoff Hollington 

Hollington studied design at the Royal College of Art in London in the early 1970s and shortly afterward ""discovered"" Herman Miller and the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames. ""If you asked me, way back, what`s the one company in the world I`d really like to work for, it would have been Herman Miller,"" he says. 
His hands come up to carve a rectangle out of the air as he describes the designer`s challenge of creating a humane environment for work. ""In the 1960s and 1970s, we tended to think of offices as factories or laboratories. We`re moving into a time when we think of offices as places where we can be creative."" 
It is this approach to design that makes his designs as appropriate for 
the home as for the office.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Herman Miller Relay ""Puppy"" Mobile Storage Unit

With arms, and carpet/hard floor casters 

A caper is a light-hearted leap. Thus, Caper—a family of nimble, stylish chairs that make moving easy and brighten up a room with their color and flair. Pull up a couple of Caper chairs for collaborative work. Pull one up as a side chair. Pull a whole Caper Cart of chairs from the conference room to the cafeteria. 

Caper chairs provide the kind of flexibility active workers crave. Lightweight, portable, stackable, movable—they help people come together, move around—whatever the work demands. 

Small but mighty comfortable. The contoured, flexible seat and back evenly distribute weight, minimize pressure points, and let the user move freely. Both the seat and back are perforated with small holes to help keep the sitter cool. 

Seats are available with FLEXNET, a strong, breathable suspension material that enhances comfort and distributes weight evenly. 

Each Caper chair is 100% recyclable and made of 21% recycled material. Because all Caper chairs, including the multipurpose chair, weigh about half as much as competitive models, fewer materials and less energy are required for their manufacture. Caper chairs adhere to McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry (MBDC) Cradle to Cradle Design Protocol and are GREENGUARD certified and may contribute to LEED credits.

The General Fireproofing Company (GF) Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model #2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models #4303 and #4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Good Form Swivel Arm Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","8ft Eames Racetrack Dining Table

Architect and designer Warren Platner (1919-) was born in Baltimore and graduated from the Cornell University School of Architecture in 1941. He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. 

Platner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","24"" Vintage Knoll Platner Oak Top Bronze Base Side End Table

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Jens Risom Red-Orange Side Chairs

The line has expanded to include Unika Vaev textiles.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Alvar Aalto

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Alvar Aalto Square Birch Table

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material.

After Frankl completed his architectural studies at the Berlin Polytechnic, he traveled, spending time in Berlin and Copenhagen before arriving in the United States in April 1914. He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Dresser with Smooth and Combed Oak by Paul Frankl -1940s","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","60 "" L x 20"" D x 33"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","Click here for shipping options   Preparation, Timing and ShipmentPlease Allow 7 to 10 Business Days Plus Shipping Time, Shipping Varies By Location and Shipping Method Chosen.If Item needs restoration additional time will be required(Determined by item or items being refinished or reupholstered) International Shipping  When requesting international shipping rates, please allow Us 3 to 5 Days to QuoteThank you for shopping Metro Retro Furniture for further questions please contact us at 713-473-0000"

Edward Wormley was born in 1907 in Rochelle, Illinois, and died in 1995. In 1926 he went to study briefly at the Art Institute of Chicago. Funds ran out and he went to work as an interior designer for Marshall Fields & Company department store. During the Depression, Wormley was introduced to the president of Dunbar Furniture Company of Berne, Indiana, who hired him to upgrade their product line. 

Dunbar made a good choice, as Wormley`s work met with immediate success. In 1944 the company decided to focus strictly on Modern lines, and Edward Wormley rose to the task, incorporating European and Scandinavian innovations. 

His eye for quality and the exacting craftsmanship at Dunbar made for furniture that was elegant, understated and exceptionally well-made. Wormley was never really at the forefront of Modern design. Instead, he took the best elements from classical, historical design and translated them into Modern vernacular. The result was furniture that was sophisticated, yet mainstream and very successful.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Vanity: 58"" W x 20.5 D x 29"" H

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","97"" Vintage Jens Risom Walnut Kneehole Credenza

He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","66"" Vintage Milo Baughman Glass and Chrome Etagere

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eames continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Barrett grew up and began his career in the manufacture of furniture in Durban, South Africa. In 1991 upon graduating from high school Barrett became apprenticed to Arnold Kaiser the German owner of the well renowned AO Kaiser’s Joinery. Arnold was a fantastic tradesman and very earnest boss who managed early on to engender an exceptional work ethic and lay a solid foundation in hand skills and traditional techniques in Barrett’s work which continues to give his furniture real value. 

In 1994 having finished his training Barrett was invited to work for a world class Italian Furniture Manufacturer called M&S Interiors. There he was fortunate to meet Sylvio Coppola who was a brilliant Italian craftsman. He taught Barrett the finer skills of drawing and the real art of creating fine furniture. During this time Barrett worked on as many specialty projects with Sylvio as he could, including timber wall panelling, decorative timber ceilings, staircases, balustrades and furniture. 

During the summer of 1998 Barrett left South Africa to visit friends in Australia. During this time he met his future wife! Thus a short holiday became a new home. Here in South Australia Barrett obtained immediate employment with Eureka Furniture where he found that he greatly developed his designing skills and continued to further his creative ability, however, longing to be his own boss Barrett started (Furniture by Barrett) in 2001. His aim has always been to produce the highest quality handcrafted furniture possible for the person who can appreciate the (art).","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","J.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Upholstered Herman Miller Shell Arm Chairs

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Original Bertoia Full Diamond Chair Cushion Beige and White Pattern

In London on December 8th, 1854 William John Blenko was born to a middle class English family. William became interested in glass adornment at an early age, and being encouraged by his mother apprenticed himself to a glass craftsman. He attended school and became a pupil of a philosopher John Tyndall. Early in the 1880s he went into business for himself making what is known as rondels (Round Window Panes), while experimenting with other processes of making glass superior to his competitors.

"(5) Vintage Ward Bennett Brickel Arm Chairs","MR11858","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Brickel Associates","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Ward Bennett

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(5) Vintage Ward Bennett Brickel Arm Chairs

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Burgundy Bronze Milo Baughman Modular Lounge Chair

primary role in trans-Saharan trade until the mid-20th century when European 
trains and trucks took over. Goods that once were brought north to the edge of the Sahara are now taken to the coast by train and then shipped to Europe and beyond. 
Tuareg history begins in northern Africa where their presence was recorded by Herodotus. Many groups have slowly moved southward over the last 2,000 years in response to pressures from the north and the promise of a more prosperous 
land in the south. Today, many Tuareg live in sedentary communities in the cities bordering the Sahara that once were the great centers of trade for western Africa.

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Ward Bennett Brickel Arm Chairs","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","24"" Width x 24.5"" Depth x 32"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent

He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","66"" Vintage Milo Baughman Glass and Chrome Etagere","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","66.5"" Width x 20"" Depth x 72"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage

The change from highly realistic anatomy models to decorative depictions is indicative of the changes in the balance of medical power and of new cultural beliefs about science and medicine in the twentieth century. 

The Clay-Adams model was produced by an American company in Japan in the 1930s. The exterior and interior are made of papier-mache, and are hand painted and lacquered. 

The Clay-Adams model is like an impressionist painting - from a distance the structures and organs look well-formed, but up close are hardly identifiable at all. 

Unlike the realistic wax models of the 18th and 19th centuries, twentieth-century models do not provoke an extreme reaction from viewers.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","12"" W x 50"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Vintage

He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman for Thayer Coggin Parsons Style Extension Dining Table

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames Blue Fiberglass Side Shell Chair with Wood Dowel Base

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Walnut Jens Risom Credenza

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Original Bertoia Full Diamond Chair Cushion Pink Pattern

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torches and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torches whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage T.H.

Michael Thonet is one of the most important innovators in bent wood furniture making.

went on sale in 1902. 

It attained iconic status when the architect Le Corbusier chose it to furnish his Pavilion de l’Esprit Nouveau (the Pavilion of the New Spirit) at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Le Corbusier justified his choice by explaining: “We believe that this chair, millions of which are in use… is a noble thing.” Architects flocked to Paris for the 1925 Exposition from all over the world and Le Corbusier’s pavilion was one of the most admired installations.

Finn Juhl was first and foremost famous for his furniture. In the 1940s, he broke with the established furniture tradition and designed a number of creations that regenerated Danish furniture design. At the MilanTriennials in the 1950s, he was awarded no fewer than five gold medals and won international acclaim for his furniture. But Finn Juhl was not only an excellent furniture designer: he worked with all aspects of the architect´s profession. He gained international renown as an interior designer for his work on the Trusteeship Council Chamber at United Nations headquarters in New York. As an exhibition architect, he was the man behind the major showings of Danish applied art abroad which created the concept ""Danish design"" and paved the way for the Danish furniture industry´s export triumphs in the 1960s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) Finn Juhl Sculptural Solid Teak Dining Chairs

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torches and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torches whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","30"" Vintage T.H.

Italian artist and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia`s career began in the 1930s as a student at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he re-established the metal-working studio and, taught as head of the department, from 1939 until 1943 until it was closed due to wartime restrictions on materials. During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 

Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. 

Harry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Vintage Original Bertoia Full Diamond Chair Cushion Red and Pink Pattern

Tom McHugh, AIA, is an award-winning Architect, Interior and Furniture Designer with over thirty-five years of experience on a variety of project types, sizes, and complexities; with concentration on hospitality and corporate interiors. 
He is a pioneer in alternative officing concepts in the US and England, and was one of the first designers to implement ""hotelling"" offices in America. Mr. McHugh has given featured presentations on this subject at numerous industry events. 
He has worked for prestigious architectural firms in the US and London, including S.O.M., Maxwell Frey and Jane Drew, and Poalo Soleri. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Savannah College of Art and Design, and was recently selected to be included in the Museum Of Modern Art, `Design Encyclopedia`. 
Mr. McHugh is a member of the National AIA Design Awards Task Force, the National AIA Interiors Steering Committee, and was the 1998 National Chair of the Interiors PIA. His design work has been exhibited at galleries in the US and Canada, including the Cooper Hewitt and the National Building Museum. 
His contract furniture work is experimental, elegant, dramatic, friendly, poetic, minimalistic; softened with curvilinear lines and anthropomorphic references. His approach is intuitive and sensory; with concern for the way the user will experience the object; and how the object adds value to the space. 
The inside/outside sensuous flow of the upholstery on the front of the Tisbury Lounge Series was inspired by the undulating skin which connected the ears to the head of his dog ""Tisbury"" from Martha`s Vineyard. He is currently sniffing around his new puppy, ""Mobie,"" for new morphological furniture ideas.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Keilhauer Belle Lounge Chairs Bentwood Tom HcHugh ~Reduced Price 20% off Original Price Was $2,000

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Herman Miller Eames Aluminum Group Executive Chair

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born at Kuortane, Finland, February 3, 1898. He received his diploma in architecture from the Helsinki Institute of Technology in 1921. There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. 

From 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. 

In the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Artek Alvar Aalto 406 Lounge Armchairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","10ft Vintage Herman Miller Eames Conference Table

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","97"" Vintage Jens Risom Walnut Kneehole Credenza

"(4) Vintage Swivel Good Form Adjustable Aluminum Arm Chairs SOLD","MR12329","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","The General Fireproofing Company .GF. 

The General Fireproofing Company .GF. Founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio as a manufacturer of building materials. During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. 
In 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commerical office desks in the world. 
The world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with woodgrain finishes. 
The “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model .2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redeisgned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models .4303 and .4304 were announced. 
During World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. 
Many of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg",".4. Vintage Swivel Good Form Adjustable Aluminum Arm Chairs

"(2 ) Herman Miller Geoff Hollington Relay File Cabinet","MR11274","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Herman Miller 

Herman Miller, Inc., based in Zeeland, Michigan, is a major American manufacturer of office furniture and equipment, as well as furniture for the home. It is notable as one of the first companies to produce modern furniture and, under the guidance of Design Director George Nelson, is likely the most prolific and influential producer of furniture of the modernist style. Among classic Herman Miller products are the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the ""Action Office II"") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst.Herman Miller holds a unique position among furniture manufacturers for having cultivated the talents of a large number of modernist designers, producing a significant number of pieces that are now considered icons of industrial design.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Geoff Hollington 

Hollington studied design at the Royal College of Art in London in the early 1970s and shortly afterward ""discovered"" Herman Miller and the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames. ""If you asked me, way back, what`s the one company in the world I`d really like to work for, it would have been Herman Miller,"" he says. 
His hands come up to carve a rectangle out of the air as he describes the designer`s challenge of creating a humane environment for work. ""In the 1960s and 1970s, we tended to think of offices as factories or laboratories. We`re moving into a time when we think of offices as places where we can be creative."" 
It is this approach to design that makes his designs as appropriate for 
the home as for the office.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Herman Miller Geoff Hollington Relay Metal File Cabinet

Russel Wright (April 3, 1904 – December 21, 1976) was an American Industrial designer during the 20th century. Beginning in the late 1920s through the 1960s, Russel Wright created a succession of artistically distinctive and commercially successful items that helped bring modern design to the general public. 

Russel Wright’s method of design came from the belief that the table was the center of the home. Designing in layers from there outwards, he designed tableware to larger furniture, architecture to landscaping, all according to his concept of easy, informal living. It was through his immensely popular and widely distributed housewares and furnishings that he revolutionized the way Americans lived and organized their homes in the mid 20th century. 

Wright`s legacy continues today as his company Russel Wright Studios remains an active industrial design licensing firm. With offices in Garrison, New York and Burbank, California, Russel Wright Studios continues to work with corporate and public clients in the licensing and manufacturing of his designs and products.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","60 Piece Vintage Russel Wright China Set

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Milo Baughman Extension Dining Table

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

It can be arranged in many different sizes and configurations and can change and grow to reflect changing work patterns. The Burdick Group dining table offered by Herman Miller for the Home is one of the products in this line. Home office configurations are available as well.

Form L Configuration 

The beam is the visual and structural base for any workstation. Beams and base assemblies carry energy and cables to components. Grouping related components on the beam creates work zones, each zone supporting a different type of work. Most components are easily removed and re-mounted. 

Peninsula surfaces attach to beams to create meeting zones within workstations. Half-rounds can be added to rectangular surfaces to form workstation peninsulas or race-track shaped conference tables. 

The project table mounted behind the table is for active paperwork; holds reference materials and keeps tools and other items off the active workspace. Grommet` s bring telephone cords or energy to the surface. 

Drawers, work surfaces, and all other components attach to the beam with brackets in one of three ways: They mount on top of, hang from, or cantilever from the beam.

"Vintage Pair of Asian Motif Cabinets in the Style of James Mont","MR11440","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","James Mont 

When considering the Hollywood Regency period of design, words like ""luxurious"" and ""glamorous"" certainly come to mind, along with gorgeous images of sumptuous interiors. Well there was one designer in that time period that brought of few other words into the mix, such as ""hot-tempered"" and ""murderous"". I`m talking of course about James Mont, who brought an air of danger and violence to his design, but who is a stunning source of inspiration nonetheless. 

James Mont was born in Istanbul in 1904, originally named Demetrios Pecintoglu. Details of his early life aren`t very clear, but we know his father was a famous artist from Turkey, and it is thought that Mont studied both art and architecture in France and Spain. Mont eventually came to the U.S. with his family in the 1920s. 

His start in the interior design profession is interesting. In the mid 1920s Brooklyn, Mont was running an electrical supply store where he also showcased his own lamp designs. It`s thought that Frankie Yale, a local mafia leader, was so impressed by Mont`s talent while in the shop one day, he hired him to decorate his home. Word spread of the great job Mont did on Yale`s home, and soon Mont was decorating all the homes of the Mafia. And if that isn`t juicy enough, Mont specialized in building furniture to conceal illegal activities, like collapsible bars (this was during prohibition) and desks with secret compartments. Once he realized interior design was the field for him, it didn`t take him long to rack up a long list of famous and infamous clients, including celebrities like Irving Berlin, Lana Turner and Bob Hope (who was the best man at his wedding) and famous mobsters of the time, like Lucky Luciano and Frank Costello.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Pair of Asian Motif Cabinets in the Style of James Mont

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Brno Tubular Side Chair

One of the first cantilevered chair designs to be produced, Ludwig Mies van der Rohes Brno Tubular Chair is the most elegant of its kind. The mirror-finish chromed tubular steel frame is fluidly bent into a sinuous single-piece form, which gracefully supports the sitter while seemingly defying gravity. 
A lengthy triple-plate chroming process ensures a resilient, 
rust-resistant mirror-quality finish. 

The padded seat is upholstered in leather for long-enduring appearance retention and ease of maintenance-two especially important features for offices and waiting areas. 
The manageable weight of the design also allows for use around dining and

"Pair of  Vintage Vladimir Kagan Patent Leather Nautilus Swivel Lounge Chairs","MR12491","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Vladimir Kagan

Vladimir Kagan is one of today`s most enduring designers of modern furniture with a career that has spanned more than sixty years. He started designing in 1946 and by the early Fifties, his innovative sculptured designs created a new look in American furniture. Today, his sparkling creations are on the cutting edge of the 21st century. His designs are spearheading creative designs for hotels, furniture, textiles and home furnishings. 

Born in Worms on the Rhine, Germany in 1927, Vladimir Kagan came to the United States in 1938. His earliest focus was on painting and sculpture but in his formative years he became exceedingly attracted to architecture and design. He studied Architecture at Columbia University and in 1947 joined his father, Illi Kagan, a master cabinetmaker, to work in his woodworking shop and learn furniture making from the ground up. 

Early commissions included the Delegate`s Cocktail Lounges for the first United Nations Headquarters in Lake Success N.Y. .1947-48.. In 1948 he opened his first shop in New York on East 65th Street and moved to fashionable 57th Street in 1950. His clients were luminaries in the world of art, theater, music and industry. They included Marilyn Monroe, Xavier Cugat, Lily Pons, Gary Cooper, Sherman Fairchild of Fairchild Aviation, Walt Disney, General Electric, Monsanto, General Motors, Prudential Insurance, and the Government of Venezuela. 

Connoisseurs and museums are avidly collecting his designs today. Kagan`s furniture is in the private collections of Barbara Jacobson of the Museum of Modern Art, film director David Lynch, actor Dan Akroyd, the Spice Girls and David Bowie, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Courtney Cox, Demi Moore, Uma Thurman as well as the late artists Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe, Frank Sinatra and Violinist Isaac Stern. Fashion designers Tom Ford, Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani, Joseph, Elie Tahari, Roberto Cavalli, and Anna Fendi, Barry Diller, Dian Von Furstenberg are all Kagan collectors.

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torches and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torches whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage T.H.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Herman Miller Aluminum Group Management Chair

The Aluminum Group chairs were originally developed in 1958 as a special project by Charles and Ray Eames for a private residence being designed by Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard. The seat-back suspension was a major technical achievement and represented a departure from the concept of the chair as a solid shell.

The Bank of England (sometimes called ""The Old Lady"") is the central bank of the United Kingdom, the model on which most modern, large central banks have been based. An armchair with a particularly dignified relationship to the human form is most associated with the history of the Bank of England, its elegantly curving rail and flat spindles fitting the contour of the back. By the turn of the century, Bank of England seats and arms were mounted on swivel bases with casters and were some of the most fashionable desk chairs in financial institutions and courthouse chambers. 

The ""Bank of England"" Swivel Chair is a formal yet functional piece that embodies pneumatic controls for the proper seat height adjustment,

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage George Nelson for Herman Miller Arm Chairs

Early in the 1880s he went into business for himself making what is known as rondels (Round Window Panes), while experimenting with other processes of making glass superior to his competitors.

(1925-) 
He is one of the most significant, distinctly American designers to leave his mark on the latter half of the 20th Century. Baughman`s résumé includes work created for Calif-Asia, Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Winchendon and Drexel, among many others. He also taught and wrote prolifically on the state of modern design, helping early on to define the concept of Good Design with his signature critical levity. A 1953 essay, for example, finds him cautioning readers ""a forest of black iron threatens to overwhelm us,"" and encouraging ""stimulating a healthy diversity."" His beautiful, thoroughly unpretentious furniture appealed to people looking for a modern, forward-thinking aesthetic on a moderate budget. Baughman continued to design furniture into the 1990`s with High Point, NC based Thayer Coggin, the firm with whom he experienced the longest relationship and widest market success.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Pair of Vintage Milo Baughman Armchairs

"Pair of Cloisonné Ducks","MR12183","","Cloisonné is an ancient technique for decorating objects, in recent centuries using ena.el and inlaying glass and other materials. The resulting

for clothes, weapons or similar small objects decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the techniques using thinner wires were developed to allow more pictorial images to be produced, mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and now always using ena.el. By the 14th century this ena.el technique had spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases; the technique remains common in China to the present day, and cloisonné ena.el objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg",".2.

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune. 

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.

Marcel Lajos Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary in 1902, and became one of the greatest architects and furniture designers of the 20th century. 
Breuer used new technologies and new materials in order to develop his ""International Style"" of work. 
Breuer first studied art in Vienna, but was unhappy with the institution and found work at an architecture office. From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. 
After completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of ""young master"".","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Stendig Wassily Marcel Breuer Leather Chairs

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(4) One Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe Brno Tubular Side Chair

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. 
Bertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space.

The world`s most singular, severely elegant collection of contemporary furniture has been created by Nicos Zographos. He has produced more than 300 kinds of products for thousands of spaces in America and Europe. Zographos is the last adherent to the strict aesthetic principles first defined by the European Bauhaus school, and he is very likely one of the last designers to manage his own manufacturing company. Within a business bounded by commercial constraints, his enduring values have significantly influenced both the style and the standards of the modern furniture industry.

He then changed the seat to a plastic shell that, when connected to the frame, formed a total structure; with this design innovation, the 1305U chair was born. It was originally designed for installation at the Yale School of Architecture student center.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","29"" Width x 32"" Depth x 29"" Height

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s. 
Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Eames Grey Blue Fabric Fiberglass Armchair Stool

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torches and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torches whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","72"" Vintage T.H.

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(1) Van Der Rohe Brno Chair

He was the president and sole owner of Karl Springer Ltd., with showrooms in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo and additional outlets in Munich and Chicago. 

His signature styles were classical Chinese and Art Deco, the latter inspired by his predecessors Ruhlmann and Jean-Michel Frank. Other influences seen in his creations ranged from the Bauhaus of Germany, his native country, to the Ashanti of Africa. Craftsmen around the world implemented his designs and he traveled widely to oversee the workshops and to scout for new ideas, forms and materials. 

Mr. Springer was credited with reviving shagreen, the rough skin of an Asian shark, which had been popular as a fabric in the 1920`s but had fallen out of favor. He brought the use of lacquered parchment back into furniture manufacturing as well and also worked with inlaid-wood veneers, rare woods, metals, faux finishes and granite.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Newly Reupholstered in Ostrich Leather","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","37"" W w x 25"" D

Known to his friends and associates as Lajkó, Breuer studied and taught at the Bauhaus in the 1920s. The Bauhaus curriculum stressed the simultaneous education of its students in elements of visual art, craft and the technology of industrial production. Breuer was eventually appointed to a teaching position as head of the school`s carpentry workshop. He later practiced in Berlin, designing houses and commercial spaces. In the 1920s and 1930s, Breuer pioneered the design of tubular steel furniture.

In the early 1900s Marshall Burns Lloyd, an American, received several patents for his process of using loomed twisted kraft paper, partially reinforced with steel wire and woven to be stronger and more attractive than wicker. 
The new loomed woven fabric meant that a chair could be produced in a quarter of the time it took to make a rattan or wicker version. The end product was not only more beautiful but much more durable, as well. 
In America, Mr. Lloyd`s product became quite famous. His company was merged with Heywood-Wakefield, who went out of business in the 1980s.

In Europe, the manufacturer in London purchased the rights and specialized equipment from Lloyd Manufacturing in 1921 and became hugely successful.

Over the years, Lloyd Loom British Woven Fibre Furniture has been seen on ocean liners, in hotels and tearooms; it became standard issue for the British Army and RAF all over the world; it even graced the Royal Boxes at Wimbledon, Henley and Twickenham and is often seen ""keeping the British end up"" at Royal functions","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","Alfons Bach

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","97"" Vintage Jens Risom Walnut Kneehole Credenza

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

"(2) Vintage Maurice Villency Mid Century Bar Stools","MR12360","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","MAURICE VILLENCY 


Maurice Villency, a pioneer in the design of contemporary furniture whose signature served as the logo for his chain of stores in the New York metropolitan region, died Sunday morning of heart failure at his home in Brookville, L.I. He was 85 years old. 

Mr. Villency, convinced that modern contemporary designs could compete with traditional and early American furniture, began designing and building his own furniture in a loft on East Eighth Street in Greenwich Village more than 50 years ago. 

Among his first successes was the sectional couch, which he designed and manufactured. He introduced Scandinavian modern furniture to the United States in the early 1950.s, insisting on qualilty and workmanship. 

His four Maurice Villency stores in the New York metropolitan region also feature contemporary furniture from Europe, including Italy, France and Belgium, although half of his stock is still manufactured in the United States. This family-owned company also operates three stores under the name of Preferred Seating. 

Mr. Villency was born in 1901 in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of a cabinet maker. At age 15, his family came to the United States and settled in Binghamton, N.Y. While crossing the Atlantic, their steamer was stopped by a German submarine and searched, but not sunk.","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage Mid Century Bar Stools

"Vintage Original George Nelson Sunflower Wall Clock ( abm40 )","MR11125","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","George Nelson

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","George Nelson Sunflower Clock

Salvador Domènec Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, Marquis de Púbol .May 11, 1904 – January 23, 1989., known as Salvador Dalí was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. 

Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in 1931. Dalí`s expansive artistic repertoire includes film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media. 

 
Dalí was highly imaginative, and also had an affinity for partaking in unusual and grandiose behavior. His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork to the dismay of those who held his work in high esteem and to the irritation of his critics.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Dimensions: 30 x 18 in. contained in a velor portfolio box with description.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Condition: Excellent"

Jacobsen began training as a mason before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts, Copenhagen where he won a silver medal for a chair that was then exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Art Decoratifs in Paris. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.

During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Fritz Hansen Cream Leather Series 7 Side Chair

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchieres and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchieres whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Mid Century Robsjohn-Gibbings 3 Drawer Dresser

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Van Der Rohe Brno Chairs

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Marcel Lajos Breuer (22 May 1902 Pecs, Hungary – 1 July 1981 New York City), was a Hungarian-born modernist, architect and furniture designer of Jewish descent. One of the masters of Modernism, Breuer displayed interest in modular construction and simple forms. 

Known to his friends and associates as Lajko, Breuer studied and taught at the Bauhaus in the 1920s. The Bauhaus curriculum stressed the simultaneous education of its students in elements of visual art, craft and the technology of industrial production. Breuer was eventually appointed to a teaching position as head of the school`s carpentry workshop. He later practiced in Berlin, designing houses and commercial spaces. In the 1920s and 1930s, Breuer pioneered the design of tubular steel furniture. Later in his career he would also turn his attention to the creation of innovative and experimental wooden furniture.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Studio Cesca Side Chair

Paul T. Frankl (1886–1958), an Art Deco furniture designer and maker, architect, painter and writer from Vienna, Austria, was the son of a wealthy real estate speculator. After Frankl completed his architectural studies at the Berlin Polytechnic, he traveled, spending time in Berlin and Copenhagen before arriving in the United States in April 1914. He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vanity with Mirror Dresser with Smooth and Combed Oak by Paul Frankl -1940s

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","81"" Vintage Jens Risom Walnut Desk

Quite simply, there is no area of art and design in which Ward Bennett has not been involved. His career evolved from his teen years onward, when he left home at thirteen and began traveling at sixteen. Travel, he says has continually been a prevailing influence on his work. Early on, he undertook various studies in the fine arts including drawing at the Porto Romano school in Florence and in Paris with Brancusi, painting in New York with Hans Hoffman and sharing space at the Clay Club with Louise Nevelson. His sculpture was exhibited at the Whitney Annual of 1944.

Best known for his interiors, Mr. Bennett`s projects include residence in New York, London, Venice and Rome, as well as his own quarter--a Manhattan apartment atop the Dakota, a country house in Long Island and a flat in Paris. In the commercial category, works encompass a national network of showrooms for Brickel, projects for Chase Manhattan Bank and consultant plans for the Solow Building Corporation. In 1963, he began a collaboration with Brickel Associates, designing first furniture and later textiles. He is considered a prodigious designer of objects: china, glassware and silver for Tiffany and Company; flatware for Supreme; porcelain for Sasaki; and, leather goods for Hermes. Bennett designs are well represented in the Museum of Modern Art`s permanent collection and in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.

Brickel Associates became Geiger Brickel. The company was recently acquired by Herman Miller.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Pair of Chairs by War Bennett","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","23"" width x 25"" depth x 35"" height

Mies van der Rohe began his career in architecture in Berlin, working as an architect first in the studio of Bruno Paul and then, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, Peter Behrens. In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Knoll Mies Van Der Rohe MR Glass Side Tables","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","29"" Diameter 19.75"" Height","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent"

"(2) Vintage T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings for Widdicomb Cocktail Tables SOLD","MR11934","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Widdicomb","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/designer.jpg","T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art DÃ©co style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Vintage T.H.

"(2) Pair of Vintage Asian Cloisonné Ducks","MR12182","","Cloisonné is an ancient technique for decorating objects, in recent centuries using enamel and inlaying glass and other materials. The resulting 
objects can also be called cloisonné.  
The technique was in ancient times mostly used for jewelry and small fittings
for clothes, weapons or similar small objects decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the techniques using thinner wires were developed to allow more pictorial images to be produced, mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and now always using enamel. By the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases; the technique remains common in China to the present day, and cloisonné enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","(2) Pair of Cloisonné Ducks","","","",""

Today, thanks to the availability of polypropylene, the basic idea behind the design of a single-piece yet comfortable chair has been realized. Made of polypropyleneVitra’s products and concepts are developed in Switzerland by applying a diligent design process that brings together the company’s engineering excellence with the creative genius of leading international designers. It is our goal to create products with a high functional and aesthetic life expectancy. 

The Panton Chair has always been a favourite of children. They not only like its bright, cheerful colours and smooth curves, but the fact that it is as much fun to play with as it is to sit on. Soon after its introduction, Verner Panton began to consider the idea of producing a child-size version of the chair together with Vitra. 

What was financially unfeasible over 35 years ago is now possible: Vitra introduces the Panton Junior, whose production is based on the original plans of Verner Panton. Identical to the regular model with regard to material and shape, the Panton Junior is approximately 25 percent smaller. This makes it an ideal chair for children in pre-school and primary grades.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","18.50""w · 22.75""d · 32.50""h","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/shipp.jpg","Click here for shipping options   Preparation, Timing and ShipmentPlease Allow 7 to 10 Business Days Plus Shipping Time, Shipping Varies By Location and Shipping Method Chosen.If Item needs restoration additional time will be required(Determined by item or items being refinished or reupholstered) International Shipping  When requesting international shipping rates, please allow Us 3 to 5 Days to QuoteThank you for shopping Metro Retro Furniture for further questions please contact us at 713-473-0000"

Jens Risom emigrated from Europe to the U.S. when he was just 23 years of age. Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. 

Jens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as ""very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make."" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. 

Risom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. 

In the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage Walnut Jens Risom Credenza

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage George Nelson for Herman Miller Walnut Credenza

Finn Juhl was first and foremost famous for his furniture. In the 1940s, he broke with the established furniture tradition and designed a number of creations that regenerated Danish furniture design. At the MilanTriennials in the 1950s, he was awarded no fewer than five gold medals and won international acclaim for his furniture. But Finn Juhl was not only an excellent furniture designer: he worked with all aspects of the architect´s profession. He gained international renown as an interior designer for his work on the Trusteeship Council Chamber at United Nations headquarters in New York. As an exhibition architect, he was the man behind the major showings of Danish applied art abroad which created the concept ""Danish design"" and paved the way for the Danish furniture industry´s export triumphs in the 1960s.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg",".4.

Mr. Villency, convinced that modern contemporary designs could compete with traditional and early American furniture, began designing and building his own furniture in a loft on East Eighth Street in Greenwich Village more than 50 years ago. 

Among his first successes was the sectional couch, which he designed and manufactured. He introduced Scandinavian modern furniture to the United States in the early 1950`s, insisting on qualilty and workmanship. 

His four Maurice Villency stores in the New York metropolitan region also feature contemporary furniture from Europe, including Italy, France and Belgium, although half of his stock is still manufactured in the United States. This family-owned company also operates three stores under the na.e of Preferred Seating.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","12ft Oak Herman Miller Eames Conference Table

"Mid Century Modern Adrian Pearsall for Kroehler Sectional Sofa","MR12458","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/manufac.jpg","Kroehler 


In 1902, Peter E. Kroehler bought the Naper ville Lounge Co., a maker of wooden lounge chairs and upholstered furniture. Kroehler built a new factory in Naperville in 1913 after the original facility was destroyed by a tornado. Soon thereafter, he rena.ed the company Kroehler Manufacturing Co. This enterprise soon operated across the country and employed several hundred men and women in the Chicago area. By the middle of the 1940s, with over $20 million in annual sales, Kroehler was the second-largest furniture maker in the United States. During the 1960s, when the company employed close to 8,000 people around the country, annual revenues passed $100 million. The company struggled during the 1970s, closing its historic Naperville factory in 1978 and ending its operations in the area. In 1981 Kroehler was acquired by the ATR Group of Northbrook, which put the com- pany up for sale. By the early 2000s, furniture was still manufactured under the Kroehler na.e by two unrelated companies, one in North Carolina and the other in Ontario, Canada.","","","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Delmar L.

Charles and Ray married in 1941 and moved to California where they continued their furniture design work with molding plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called ""the chair of the century"" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Examples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Eames for Herman Miller Vintage Compact Folding Sofa","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","71"" W x 37"" D x 35"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Good Vintage Condition

Marcel Lajos Breuer (22 May 1902 Pécs, Hungary – 1 July 1981 New York City), was a Hungarian-born modernist, architect and furniture designer of Jewish descent. One of the masters of Modernism, Breuer displayed interest in modular construction and simple forms. 

Known to his friends and associates as Lajkó, Breuer studied and taught at the Bauhaus in the 1920s. The Bauhaus curriculum stressed the simultaneous education of its students in elements of visual art, craft and the technology of industrial production. Breuer was eventually appointed to a teaching position as head of the school`s carpentry workshop. He later practiced in Berlin, designing houses and commercial spaces. In the 1920s and 1930s, Breuer pioneered the design of tubular steel furniture. Later in his career he would also turn his attention to the creation of innovative and experimental wooden furniture.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Knoll Breuer Cesca Chair Maroon Red

George Nelson (1908-1986) was an important modernist whose work cut across the fields of interior, industrial and exhibition design. Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.

In 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. 

Among Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage George Nelson for Herman Miller Executive Desk

In the late 1930s and in the Forties, British-born Robsjohn-Gibbings was the most important decorator in America. He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. ""He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,"" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. 

One of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchres and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called ""opulent simplicity"" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. 

Since then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torches whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Vintage T.H.

Born as Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town of Neuchâtel canton in northwestern Switzerland, just across the border from France. He moved to Paris permanently at the age of 29 in 1916 and in 1920 adopted ""Le Corbusier"", slightly altered from his maternal grandfather`s name ""Le Corbesier"", as a pseudonym. Some architectural historians claim that this pseudonym translates as ""the crow-like one."" Around this time he began to work on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. 
The new architecture came to be known as the International Style. Of its many partisans. Among them were Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in Germany, and Theo van Doesburg in Holland. None was better known than Le Corbusier. 
Le Corbusier was the most important architect of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright was more prolific, but Wright was a maverick.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.

Born Karl Emanuel Martin Weber in Berlin, Germany, Weber initially trained under the royal cabinet maker Eduard Schultz in Potsdam, before enrolling at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Decorative Arts) in Berlin in 1908 where he studied under Bruno Paul. Graduating in 1912, Weber went on to work in Paul.s office, having previously assisted his tutor in the design of the German pavilion at the 1910 .Exposition Universalle. in Brussels.[1] 

It was the design of a second pavilion that proved to be the turning point in Weber.s career. Paul sent his assistant to San Francisco, California to supervise work on the German pavilion being built for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915. However, Weber was soon overtaken by other international events. The onset of World War I prevented him from returning home despite the construction of the pavilion being suspended, leaving him stranded in California.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Heywood Wakefield Trimline Desk

Maurice Villency, a pioneer in the design of contemporary furniture whose signature served as the logo for his chain of stores in the New York metropolitan region, died Sunday morning of heart failure at his home in Brookville, L.I. He was 85 years old. 

Mr. Villency, convinced that modern contemporary designs could compete with traditional and early American furniture, began designing and building his own furniture in a loft on East Eighth Street in Greenwich Village more than 50 years ago. 

Among his first successes was the sectional couch, which he designed and manufactured. He introduced Scandinavian modern furniture to the United States in the early 1950`s, insisting on qualilty and workmanship. 

His four Maurice Villency stores in the New York metropolitan region also feature contemporary furniture from Europe, including Italy, France and Belgium, although half of his stock is still manufactured in the United States. This family-owned company also operates three stores under the na.e of Preferred Seating. 

Mr. Villency was born in 1901 in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of a cabinet maker. At age 15, his family came to the United States and settled in Binghamton, N.Y. While crossing the Atlantic, their steamer was stopped by a German submarine and searched, but not sunk.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Classic Vintage Walnut Bar","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","Bar","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Very Good Near Excellent Vintage"

Italian, 1918-2006 
Mimmo Rotella was born in Catanzaro, Italy, on October 7, 1918 and currently lives in Milan. He is considered a leading artist of the twentieth century, having pioneered the use of advertising and cinema posters in collages that expressed both the modern, urban condition and a crisis in art. Rotella began in the 1950s by ripping posters off the street and then reapplying them to canvas. Later, in the 1960s, he developed a method of serial production by projecting negatives of his images onto an emulsified canvas so that they essentially became mechanically reproduced. In subsequent years, he has furthered his experiments, applying blank sheets of paper onto advertising posters and layering images on top, for example, or incorporating the use of graffiti. 

In 1992, Rotella was conferred the title of Officiel des arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, and in 2002, he was conferred the Gold Medal for visual arts by the Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/descript.jpg","Zerodisegno Rotella Marilyn Open Bookshelf","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/dims.jpg","15.75"" W  4.25"" D  78.75"" H","http://www.metroretrofurniture.com/images/pictures/condit.jpg","Excellent Showroom Sample"
