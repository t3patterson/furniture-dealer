In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Here he also explored the Bauhaus movement, embarking on a lifetime exploration of multidisciplinary design, from furniture, shelving, glassware, lighting and even toys to his pioneering work in low-cost prefabricated housing. \n\nEarly in his career, Cherner envisioned houses as a total design concept and designed affordable furniture specifically for these low-cost modular dwellings. He wrote about his theories in Make Your Own Modern Furniture (1953), How to Build Childrens Toys and Furniture (1954), Fabricating Houses from Component Parts (1958) and How to Build a House for Less than $6,000 (1960). One of his first prefabricated houses was designed, produced and assembled in 1957 for the U.S. Department of Housing. After being exhibited in Vienna, it was shipped back to Connecticut and uncrated to become his first home and studio. \n\nYet Cherner is best known for the molded plywood seating line he created for Plycraft, a manufacturing company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After telling Cherner that his design for what is now known as the Cherner Chair (1958) had been scrapped, Plycrafts owner continued to produce it, claiming himself as the designer. Soon after, the chairs popularity was heightened when it appeared in Norman Rockwells 1961 painting \"The Artist at Work\" on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post. Cherner sued the company, and Plycraft agreed to pay Cherner royalties, yet whole seating line was out of production by the early 1970s. \n\nFor almost 20 years, Cherners seating was rarely seen outside of galleries, museums and the living rooms of few lucky collectors. This all changed in 1999, when Cherners sons Benjamin and Thomas formed the Cherner Chair Company to revive the designs and produce them as their father originally intended. The repeated success of chairs inspired Benjamin, an architect and designer in his own right, to create a coordinating table, the Cherner Table (2004).",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn\"s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n \nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n \nIn the 1970\"s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

His main achievement was transferring manufacturing technology from industry to architecture, without losing aesthetic qualities. His design skills were not limited to one discipline. During his career Jean Prouvé was involved in architectural design, industrial design, structural design and furniture design. \nJean Prouve always regarded himself as more of an engineer and constructor instead of a modern designer. He never designed for the sake of form alone, concentrating instead on the essence of materials, connections and production. Jean Prouve strove for the most constructionally and materially efficient designs, with such classic end results as the modern design Standard chair of 1934 and the Antony chair of 1954.  In the mid 1950s, Jean Prouve was forced to abandon modern design furniture production and began devoting his time to the challenges of prefabricated architecture. His own house, which he designed as a prototype, is now considered a major development in prefab housing.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

He designed everything from writing desks, tables, sideboards, chairs, bar cabinets and TV-stands, mostly manufactured in popular teak or rosewood. One of his most widespread designs is the FM reolsystem (shelving system) which was designed to offer maximum flexibility with endless possibilities to combine wall-mounted shelves and cabinets to fit any wall in any home.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Pot graduated in 1998 and started working as a freelance designer as a member of Monkey Boys – a studio he co-founded with friend, Daniel White. In 2003, Pot opened his own studio and started collaborating with numerous manufacturers including Arco, Alturo Alvarez, Den Herder Production House (DHPH), Domestic, Established & Sons, Feld, Functionals, Gelderland, Goods, Innofa, Lensvelt, Montis, Moooi, Moustache, Richard Lampert, Museum Boijmans van Beuningen and Textielmuseum Tilburg.",

While appearing to be made out of wood, the construction of its form – an ultra-thin profile and sheer horizontal expanse – ultimately negate any similarly shaped table “truly” composed of wood. This is a practical and intriguing table that will leave an impact in any dining or conference room.",

Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\n\nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

American Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson stayed at the Galvez, as did General Douglas MacArthur. Other notable names include Jimmy Stewart, Frank Sinatra, and Howard Hughes.

His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies starting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch Gordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and Drexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.",

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom\"s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn\"s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970\"s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household na.e for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

His uniquely American designs were forward-thinking and distinctive, yet unpretentious and affordable. His prolific and highly influential work continues to be copied, reinvented and revived in the new and secondary decorative arts markets by contemporary furniture designers and dealers alike. Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies starting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch Gordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and Drexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

Nelsons unique design and ingenious use of materials prove to eliminate glare and provide an abundant, yet diffused light. A quality which alone is unique to this material. \n\nThese lamps have been made using the same methods and materials to handcraft each lamp that were used in 1952 with Howard Miller’s first production run. \n\nFrom the forming of the wire-frame, to the spraying of the vinyl form, one-by-one, each Bubble Lamp is constructed to last decades and each Bubble Lamp is built to George Nelson’s original specifications. \n\nEach lamp comes with a 5.25-inch brushed, nickel-plated steel ceiling plate and 6-feet of cord. \n\nThe George Nelson Bubble Lamp® collection is featured in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

He designed a chair made of scrap iron he had fabricated by a blacksmith and that he wrapped with marine cord he purchased in the Embarcadero. This work was his first documented effort to bridge nature with architecture by creating a prototype of his indoor/outdoor furniture, and in the history of industrial design was a pivotal and revolutionary accomplishment.",

Through a lifetime of artistic experimentation, he created sculptures, gardens, furniture and lighting designs, ceramics, architecture, and set designs. His work, at once subtle and bold, traditional and modern, set a new standard for the reintegration of the arts. \n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, to an American mother and a Japanese father, Noguchi lived in Japan until the age of thirteen, when he moved to Indiana. While studying pre-medicine at Columbia University, he took evening sculpture classes on New York’s Lower East Side, mentoring with the sculptor Onorio Ruotolo. He soon left the University to become an academic sculptor. \n\nIn 1926 Noguchi saw an exhibition in New York of the work of Constantin Brancusi’s that profoundly changed his artistic direction. With a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, Noguchi went to Paris, and from 1927 to 1929 worked in Brancusi’s studio. Inspired by the older artist’s reductive forms, Noguchi turned to modernism and a kind of abstraction, infusing his highly finished pieces with a lyrical and emotional expressiveness, and with an aura of mystery. \n\n\nWhen given the opportunity to venture into the mass-production of his interior designs, Noguchi seized it. In 1937 he designed a Bakelite intercom for the Zenith Radio Corporation, and in 1947, his glass-topped table was produced by Herman Miller. This design—along with others such as his designs for Akari Light Sculptures which was developed in 1951 using traditional Japanese materials—are still being produced today. \n\nIn 1985 Noguchi opened The Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (now known as The Noguchi Museum), in Long Island City, New York. The Museum, established and designed by the artist, marked the culmination of his commitment to public spaces. Located in a 1920s industrial building across the street from where the artist had established a studio in 1960, it has a serene outdoor sculpture garden, and many galleries that display Noguchi’s work, along with photographs and models from his career. \n\nNoguchi’s first retrospective in the United States was in 1968, at the Whitney Museum of American Art, in New York City. In 1986, he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale. Noguchi received the Edward MacDowell Medal for Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to the Arts in 1982; the Kyoto Prize in Arts in 1986; the National Medal of Arts in 1987; and the Order of Sacred Treasure from the Japanese government in 1988. He died in New York City in 1988.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

His entry in to the world of design came when he was working at a Brooklyn electrical supply shop, selling lamps he had designed himself.

Afra and Tobia Scarpa not only designed things, they dictated behaviors.\nFifty years of work that makes up a world that explored Italian culture and picked up on its social and economic dynamics but never gave in to the seductions of the moment or fast fashions.\nThe work of these two interpreted transformations and needs and helped in starting some of the companies that truly made Italian design. They promoted collective projects like the Carlotta armchair, which was a forerunner to the Ikeas of today, or the Soriana armchair, which was offered in a different way so it could be used in a freer way in our homes. In the 1970s, there were the Benetton stores (one store opened around the world per day), which offered a different relationship among the product, consumer and manufacturer. The stores didn’t have a front window (it was the store itself on display) and there was no cash desk. The relationship with the customer was open and transparent and never servile.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

A quality which alone is unique to this material. \n\nThese lamps have been made using the same methods and materials to handcraft each lamp that were used in 1952 with Howard Miller’s first production run. \n\nFrom the forming of the wire-frame, to the spraying of the vinyl form, one-by-one, each Bubble Lamp is constructed to last decades and each Bubble Lamp is built to George Nelson’s original specifications. \n\nEach lamp comes with a 5.25-inch brushed, nickel-plated steel ceiling plate and 6-feet of cord. \n\nThe George Nelson Bubble Lamp® collection is featured in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe.

The first personality is that seen in the craftsman cabinet-maker working in a primordial idiom, re-inventing chairs and other furniture as if no one had ever built them before him and following a structural code all of his own; the second is that of the architect working with elegant formulas, determined to drive home the rationalist and neoplastic message in the context of European architecture. The two activities alternate, overlap, and fuse in a perfect osmosis unfolding then into a logical sequence. In 1918 Rietveld joined the “De Stijl” movement which had sprung up around the review of that name founded the year before by Theo van Doesburg. The group assimilated and translated into ideology certain laws on the dynamic breakdown of compositions (carrying them to an extreme) that had already been expressed in painting by the cubists: the “De Stijl” artists also carefully studied the architectonic lesson taught by the great Frank Lloyd Wright, whose influence was widely felt in Europe at that time. \nCollaborating first with Robert van’t Hoff and Vilmos Huszar, then with Theo van Doesburg and Cornelius van Eesteren, Rietveld soon became one of the most distinguished interpreters of the neoplastic message.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

Born in Budapest in 1891, Anton Lorenz was teaching history and geography in his hometown up until 1919. After his wife, an opera singer, had found an engagement in Leipzig, he moved to Germany. Anton Lorenz had been working in the locking business in Leipzig before he moved to Berlin in 1927, where he met Kalman Lengyel, who was looking for production facilities for Marcel Breuer`s designs, with whom he had just founded the company \"Standard Möbel\" (Standard Furniture). The two business- and fellow countrymen soon found an agreement, and Anton Lorenz produced Breuer`s designs in his own metal workshop and was also business manager of \"Standard Möbel\". \nAnton Lorenz, who obviously had the right touch in businnes, was always looking for new sources of income. He was interested in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe`s cantilever chair. After van der Rohe had rejected Anton Lorenz`s offer for a joint venture, he turned to Mart Stam in 1929, who was the inventor of the cantilever chair without rear legs. Anton Lorenz acquired the rights for Stam`s chair and started his own company \"DESTA\" (Deutsche Stahlmöbel-German Steel Furniture). \"Standard Möbel\" was taken over by the company \"Thonet\" the same year. \nAfter numerous law suits over the copyrights for the cantilever chair that Lorenz had initiated and successfully managed, he gave all rights in the product range of \"DESTA\" to \"Thonet\", where he was appointed head of the legal department at the same time. \nHowever, Anton Lorenz was not only a businessman: In the 1920s he was also designing steel tube furniture. The steel tube divan with waxed thread covering \"LS 22\" from 1931 is his most famous design. The elegant minimalist piece was at first produced by \"DESTA\", but soon after by \"Thonet\". A re-edition of the modern classic was launched by Thornet in 2006. After the lawsuits over the cantilever chair had been won by Anton Lorenz, he tried to claim further patents and marketing rights for trend-setting designs. He acquired, for instance, the licenses for stackable chairs after designs by Mart Stam, Alvar Aalto and Bruno Pollak in 1953. \nHe went on a business trip to Paris in 1939, the same time World War II broke out. In the face of the political situation, Lorenz decided not to return to Germany and tried to gain a foothold overseas, staying in the furniture and patent business up until his death in Greenwich/Connecticut in 1964.",

He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.",

After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \n\nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Eventually, he established a workshop, Harvey Probber Inc., in Brooklyn, later moving his operations to Massachusetts. \n\nAn astute observer, Probber realized that the nature of post-WWII American indoor life had fundamentally changed: rooms no longer had strictly assigned functions, and the new open plan interior demanded furnishings of greater flexibility. Probber, with his finger on the pulse of the times, responded in 1944 with the invention of modular seating no mean accomplishment for one not given to academic posturing. \n\nDespite his lack of formal training, Probber lead an active and original creative life, as displayed through his renderings of interiors, and the witty caricatures he drew throughout his life of \"chairs as people,\" which served to keep his creative mind in shape. \n\nHis pieces themselves displayed the same combination of high style and popular appeal: his were no sterile creations in tubular steel Probber´s work shares more in common with Art Deco than with the machine aesthetic of the Bauhaus. It often combined rare woods, sumptuous fabrics and sinuous lines with just the right amount of avant-garde sensibility to make them widely practical and appealing and as a result his furniture set the tone for American indoor life starting in the 1950´s. \n\nProbber´s work has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years, and has become particularly collectible. He was not a household na.e in his lifetime as were some of his contemporaries Charles and Ray Eames, His \"sling chair\" was included in the famed MoMA 1951 Good Design exhibition.",

An innovator at the vanguard of modern design. Lee combines rational thinking with radical influences to create minimalist pieces with deft whimsical touches. Upon obtaining a degree in industrial design, Lee began his career in Chicago with notable furniture manufacturers and design studios. Relocating to Milan, he then honed his distinctive artistic style seen in his work today Incorporating minimal principles of Bauhaus with experience he gained collaborating at the irreverent Studio Alchimia, Lee nurtured a unique aesthetic that is both vibrant and charismatic. After more than 15 years of multi-disciplinary exploration in San Francisco, Chicago, and Milan, Lee and his team now design for major furniture manufacturers and independent clients including, Bonaldo, Magis, Surface Magazine, American Leather, DWR, San Francisco Opera Guild, Shanghai MoCA and Viken. His work has appeared in movie sets and in celebrity homes of Bruce Willis and Michael Jordon. Lee`s designs have also been widely exhibited internationally and reviewed in notable publications such as the New York Times, Metropolitan Home, Surface Magazine, Case De Abitare, ID. Metropolis, lnterni and Dwell. Lee`s theoretical approach to design hinges on the tactics of an actor. Working with a wide range of materials and resources, he prefers not to work with any one particular material on a consistent basis. Lee considers \"California cuisine\" an apt metaphor for his work—a mix of seemingly incongruent ingredients carefully combined to create something new and fresh. \n\nRick Lee shares his San Francisco design studio with his wife, fashion designer Colleen Quen from whom he draws much of his inspiration, and with whom he often collaborates.",

He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. \n \nPlatner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

When he entered the field of art and design, he took both the mathematical concepts and the philosophy that came with them in the geometric works he made from public sculpture to lamps, to board games.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

His inexpensive, mass produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances, and textiles were not only visually and technically innovative, but were also the tools to achieve his concept of \"easier living,\" a unique American lifestyle that was gracious yet contemporary and informal. \n\nWright conceived the domestic environment broadly, designing in layers from the very core of home life-the table-outward toward furnishings, interiors, architecture and landscape. From his earliest line, Informal Serving Accessories, through American Modern, postwar Iroquois Casual China, innovative plastic dishes including Flair, and Dragon Rock and Manitoga, Wrights final home and surrounding landscape, his work sought to improve peoples everyday lives. Collaborating with his wife Mary Wright, the teams marketing genius and his partner in conceiving their \"easier living\" philosophy, Russel disseminated his designs and ideas in exhibitions, books, articles, advertisements, radio interviews, and demonstration rooms in department stores. In all these enterprises, Russel and Mary converted his name and signature into a recognizable trademark on a par with major manufacturers. They invented lifestyle marketing centered on a compelling persona, paving the way for such lifestyle interpreters as Martha Stewart and Ralph Lauren. Wrights unique contribution to mid-century modernism embraced American traditions of practicality and simplicity, as well as new materials and technologies. Drawing on sources as diverse as Colonial America, Surrealist art, and Frank Lloyd Wright, Russel Wright forged an American vocabulary of form and function, and more than any other designer, shifted the nations taste toward the modern beginning in the late 1920s. \n\nCentral to the Wrights efforts to revolutionize the home was \"Guide to Easier Living\", the best-selling book they co-authored in 1950. It offered readers a declaration of independence from convention, rejecting the dogma of \"etiquette despots\" like Emily Post. Defining the way Americans live even today, Russel and Mary Wright wrote, \"Good informal living substitutes a little headwork for a lot of legwork. It doesnt need wealth, but it does take thought, some ingenuity and resourcefulness, and more than a little loving care to create a home that is really your own.\"",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame. \n.1.

The group\"s colorful, ironic pieces were hailed as one of the most characteristic examples of Post-modernism in design and the arts. \nAs an industrial designer, his clients included Fiorucci, Esprit, the Italian furniture company Poltronova, Knoll International, Serafino Zani, Alessi and Brondi. As an architect, he designed the Mayer-Schwarz Gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, with its dramatic doorway made of irregular folds and jagged angles, and the home of David M. Kelley, designer of Apple\"s first computer mouse, in Woodside, California. In the mid-1990s he designed the sculpture garden and entry gates of the W. Keith and Janet Kellogg Gallery at the campus of Cal Poly Pomona. He collaborated with well known figures in the architecture and design field, including Aldo Cibic, James Irvine, Matteo Thun. \nSottsass had a vast body of work; furniture, jewellery, ceramics, glass, silver work, lighting, office machine design and buildings which inspired generations of architects and designers. In 2006 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held the first major museum survey exhibition of his work in the United States. A retrospective exhibition, Ettore Sottsass: Work in Progress, was held at the Design Museum in London in 2007. In 2009, the Marres Centre for Contemporary Culture in Maastricht presented a re-construction of a Sottsass\" exhibition \"Miljö för en ny planet\" .Landscape for a new planet., which took place in the National Museum in Stockholm in 1969. One of his works, Telefono Enorme designed for Brondi, is part of the MOMA Collection.",

He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \"He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,\" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. \n\nOne of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called \"opulent simplicity\" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. \n\nSince then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood torchÃÂ¨res whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art DÃ©co style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.",

In 1950 he became a senior designer and assistant to Florence Knoll. He later recalled that “[Florence] would do the rough outline, and I would develop it and refine it further. I became an extension.” When Florence Knoll left the company in 1965, Butler was appointed as the head of the Planning Unit. \n\nAs was the case with the work of many Planning Unit members, Butlers furniture designs were often intended to fill in the space between what Florence called the star pieces of Bertoia and Saarinen. His simple designs were appropriately subtle and thoroughly modern. Ever-interested in visual and structural simplicity, an identifying mark of Butlers work is the wooden joint he often employed to avoid the use of excess hardware.",

He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\n\nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

In Paris he attended the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, which influenced his approach to design. He established a design consulting firm in New York City, and later the firm of Deskey-Vollmer (in partnership with Phillip Vollmer) which specialized in furniture and textile design. His designs in this era progressed from Art Deco to Streamline Moderne. \n\nHe first gained note as a designer when he created window displays for the Franklin Simon Department Store in Manhattan in 1926. In the 1930`s, he won the competition to design the interiors for Radio City Music Hall. In the 1940`s he started the graphic design firm Donald Deskey Associates and made some of the most recognizable icons of the day. He designed the Crest toothpaste packaging, as well as the Tide bullseye. His company is still in operation in Cincinnati. A collection of his work is held by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. He died in Vero Beach, Florida, the town to which he had retired in 1975.",

Robsjohn-Gibbings \nTerence Harold Robsjohn-Gibbings (1905–1976) was a British-born architect and furniture designer. \n\nRobsjohn-Gibbings studied architecture at London University. He afterwards worked briefly as a naval architect, designing ocean liner interiors, and then as art director for a motion picture studio. In 1926, he became a salesman for an antiques dealer who specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture, and Robsjohn-Gibbings was assigned prominent accounts such as Elizabeth Arden and Neiman Marcus. \n\nIn the late 1930s and 1940s he was the most important decorator in America. After opening a shop on New Yorks Madison Avenue in 1936, Robsjohn-Gibbings proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such scions as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf, and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \n\nThe design work of T. H. Robsjohn Gibbings is hallmarked as a modern mixture of the classical elements of Ancient Grecian design, and Art Deco design. It features mosaic floor reproductions, sculptural fragments, and sparse furnishings, all combining to achieve his trademark brand of modern historicism. \n\nOne of the designers most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Webers mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for the house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions paw feet, and Ionic columns in table bases, torchères, and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived and was sold intact to Conrad Hilton in 1952 and similarly sold on to its next owner, David Howard Murdock. He retained some of what was called the \"opulent simplicity\", but sold off the contents in the early 1980s. The architect might have appreciated the irony that, although the fine fittings and structure remained virtually untouched, these rooms made the perfect background for the new owners fine collection of eighteenth century English furniture. It has since been sold again. \n\nT. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings much preferred the visual vocabulary of the classical world, particularly ancient Greek furniture and design. Robsjohn-Gibbings look was widely emulated, and, from 1943–56, he worked as a designer for the Widdicomb Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n \nJens Risom\"s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn\"s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n \nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n \nIn the 1970\"s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Mulhauser, Jr. and his creations sit comfortably among the ranks of the greatest and most innovative mid-century modern furniture practitioners and designs. Over five decades, Mulhauser constantly enjoyed challenging production techniques and the way in which materials are used. \n\nPost-war America was a place for creativity and transformation. In 1953, an expressive Mulhauser was among the first recipients of Pratt Institute’s Industrial Design degree. This aided him in becoming a staff designer in a burgeoning Herman Miller design studio operating under the legendary George Nelson. Here, Mulhauser added his genius to the development of Herman Miller’s steel frame cases. \n\nCome 1955, and in his first commercial foray into chair design, Mulhauser created a 20th century design icon – the Coconut Chair, a piece often attributed to George Nelson himself. The chair was comprised of a foam upholstered shell supported upon three legs. Its arresting form is derived from the natural curvatures of its flexible, single pentagonal sheet of steel, which when pulled together creates a triangular shape. \n\nIn the 1960`s, George Mulhauser designed the symbolic Mr Chair, the first reclining lounge chair formed from a single sheet. The thought process involved was similar to that of the Coconut Chair, but this time utilised steam forming veneers into molded plywood. \n\nThe chair was produced by Plycraft in Lawrence, MA, and was also produced in Italy to cater for the European market. Its success was followed by a smaller version, suitably referred to as the Jr. Mr Chair. Later the Mr Chair name became a brand in itself when associated with the steady marketing of Mulhauser’s furniture by Directional Industries, NY. The MC 600 series was a series of chairs all produced from a single molded shell, the form of which resembled the earlier steel Coconut Chair, in ways. Unique, expandable features were devised to manufacture the curlicue plywood moldings of the Fancy-Free range, inspired by a cross-section of a chambered nautilus shell. \n\nMulhauser was meticulous when it came to the design process. Everything began as a sketch and evolved into handmade scale models. A piece’s final form and fit was tested by producing a handmade, functional mock up. His manufacturers received full size assembly drawings, patterns and documents detailing every feature. Mulhauser always endeavoured to work closely with his producers, insuring the final product was perfect.",

A \"pioneer in the application of modular seating many of his ideas have been adopted by other designers. \n\nHarvey Probber was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1922. While attending Samuel J. Tilden High School, he took a part-time job in a used-furniture store, and was inspired to try his hand at drawing ideas for furniture. Probber sold his first sofa design when he was just 16, for $10. After high school graduation, he accepted a job as designer for Trade Upholstery, a small manufacturing facility on West 17th Street. 1940 was the beginning of American modernism, a time characterized by young designers with talent, initiative, and a willingness to take risks with new ideas. Probber was one of an early band of pioneers in a field that included D.J. DePree of Herman Miller, Hans Knoll, Georg Tanier and Jack Lenor Larsen.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Long fascinated by the relationship between materials, technology, design, and function -- and given to flights of insightful socio-cultural and philosophical musings -- Kramer is recognized as one of the greatest industrial designers of our age. A graduate of the renowned engineering program at Chicago\"s Institute of Design, his achievements were myriad. Kramer devised the first truly ergonomic chair in 1946; began conceiving radically new truck designs in the early-1950s; started teaching Industrial Design at the University of Washington in 1957 and architecture workshops at the University of Oregon in 1960. In 1966 the American Institute of Architects (AIA) honored his \"outstanding achievement in fine arts, allied professions, [and] craftsmanship in the industrial arts\" by bestowing on him their coveted Industrial Arts Medal. \nKramer\"s probable greatest claim to fame was his famous and award-winning ION chair. An icon of mid-century modern furniture design, the ultra-ergonomic chair was a result of his philosophic approach to design. As Kramer told The Seattle Times in 1966, the design came about because he simply viewed the act of sitting as a \"dynamic rather than static condition.\"",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame. \n.1.

Born in Meda, a small city north of Milan, Citterio graduated in architecture from the Politecnico of Milan in 1972 and established a design studio with Paolo Nava who remained a close collaborator until 1981.  In 1973 Citterio began a long-term partnership with the furniture company, B&B Italia. \n\nThe 1990\"s marked Citterio\"s first notable achievement in furniture design when he designed a new office seating product for Vitra. Executed in steel, leather and fabric, its elegance and simplicity belied the strength of its functionality. Citterio went on to create a series of colorful folding tables and trolleys made from plastic, aluminum and steel designed to provide an appealing option for office storage. \n\nCitterio creates visual interest and harmony by combining materials and forms in original, yet relatively thoughtful and decorous ways. For example, he may mix high-tech and natural materials or rework earlier forms with stark modernist lines, but without the \"radical eclecticism\" and irony of designers like Robert Venturi and other postmodernists. Citterio received Compasso d\"Oro awards in 1979 and 1987 and has taught design at the prestigious Domus Academy.",

Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gunnar Asplund and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Jacobsen embraced a functionalist approach from the outset. He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\n\n During the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

After completing his schooling, he worked with noted designers John Follis and Herb Rosenthal before opening his own office in 1970.\nHis first product for Herman Miller was the Burdick Group system, a unique assemblage of work surfaces, paper handling and storage elements, and electronic equipment supports, located along a structural armature in whatever configuration best suits the way people work. It can be arranged in many different sizes and configurations and can change and grow to reflect changing work patterns. The Burdick Group dining table offered by Herman Miller for the Home is one of the products in this line. Home office configurations are available as well.\nIn 1980, the Burdick Group received design awards from the Institute of Business Designers and the Industrial Designers Society of America. The following year, Time magazine named the Burdick Group system one of the Best of 1981 for Industrial Design.

During this early period of his career, Tony became friends and colleagues with the likes of Ben Seibel and Arthur Umanoff. Tonys pursuits also led him overseas, where his skill and talent influenced furniture and lamp designs in Italy and Spain for many years. \nTony was affiliated with many premier mid-century modern designers during his career; early on Tony worked with Russel Wright, Paul McCobb, Ben Seibel and many others. His designs were distributed by Richards-Morganthau (also known as Raymor), Mario Industries, Mutual-Sunset, Majestic Lamp, Elk Lighting, Westwood, Robert Barber, Woodlin-Hall, The Elton Company, Avon Upholstery Company, Verplex, The Gailstyn Company, Brueton, Gilley Glass, Spanish Arts, Levco, Bitossi, Intercontinental, and others.

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\n\nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

        "field-1-value": "James Mont\n\nJames Mont was born in Istanbul in 1904, originally named Demetrios Pecintoglu. Details of his early life aren`t very clear, but we know his father was a famous artist from Turkey, and it is thought that Mont studied both art and architecture in France and Spain. Mont eventually came to the U.S. with his family in the 1920s. \n\nHis start in the interior design profession is interesting. In the mid 1920s Brooklyn, Mont was running an electrical supply store where he also showcased his own lamp designs. It`s thought that Frankie Yale, a local mafia leader, was so impressed by Mont`s talent while in the shop one day, he hired him to decorate his home. Word spread of the great job Mont did on Yale`s home, and soon Mont was decorating all the homes of the Mafia. And if that isn`t juicy enough, Mont specialized in building furniture to conceal illegal activities, like collapsible bars (this was during prohibition) and desks with secret compartments. Once he realized interior design was the field for him, it didn`t take him long to rack up a long list of famous and infamous clients, including celebrities like Irving Berlin, Lana Turner and Bob Hope (who was the best man at his wedding) and famous mobsters of the time, like Lucky Luciano and Frank Costello. \n\nPerhaps it was his nature, or maybe it was just the company he kept, but James Mont was known to have a mean streak, which even landed him in prison in 1940 when he viciously beat a lampshade designer who had declined his sexual advances. If you thought prison was the end of his design career, you thought wrong, for in 1945 he emerged from jail having spent his time perfecting his craft and coming up with new designs. \n\nHomeowners looking to add both glamour and a storied past to their own home designs will find plenty of gorgeous inspiration in Mont`s work. He was known for many details in his interiors, most notably heavy use of Oriental themes and Chinoiserie. He also excelled in a variety of unique furniture finishes. He loved using tons of mirrors, as well as silver and gold leafing in his interiors, often mixing the two for dynamic effects.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003.

He has managed to transmit to his three sons the sense of family unity which has tied the family for generations through affection and profession. \n\nAs the third generation of specialized wood craftsmen in cabinet making and restoration, in the seventies, Romeo Sozzi made his debut in interior decoration. Since 1988, he has managed his company, Promemoria, together with his three sons. In time, Promemoria has become not just a producer of internationally high profile furnishing, but a test bed of innovative design. Rigor, discipline but always with a base of enthusiasm and strong personality as bon vivant. Romeo Sozzi’s way of being does not limit itself to the professional sense, it is a continuous flow of thought which permeates every part of his life, even the most intimate. Creativity is learnt by observing, making notes, listening to harmonies, breathing fragrances.

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

There were few commissions in Finland, which was recovering from war and economic depression, so he first went to work in Sweden. In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \n\nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \n\nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \"He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art DÃ©co period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,\" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. \n\nOne of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases, torchÃÂ¨res and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called \"opulent simplicity\" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s.",

During the panic of 1907, when all building practically ceased, the company decided to emphasize their line steel office furniture. GF’s first 4-drawer steel vertical file was built in 1910, and their first fireproof safe was introduced in 1912. \nIn 1923 GF decided to produce a standardized steel desk which could be made on an assembly. This led to the introduction of the 1600 Series in 1925, which was produced well into the 1970’s. Starting in the 1950’s, these were the largest selling commericial office desks in the world. \nThe world’s first all-aluminum office chair was designed by the ALCOA company in 1924. In 1929 GF began manufacturing their own aluminum chairs, the first of which were shipped in 1930. These first chairs were copies of the wood office chairs popular at the time, and were even painted with wood grain finishes. \nThe “Goodform” seating line began in August 1932 with the introduction of the Model 2123. Ten more models were introduced in 1935. The original Comfort Master executive office chair came out in 1937 and was redesigned in 1939. Also in 1939, the institutional twin Models 4303 and 4304 were announced. \nDuring World War II, GF ceased production of all its regular products in order to manufacture aircraft parts. After VJ Day, almost the entire plant had to be converted back to the manufacture of furniture, and by 1946 the company was producing the same volume they were in 1938. In 1948, GF introduced the Mode-Maker line of executive office desks, designed in collaboration with Raymond Loewy. \nMany of GF’s furniture lines were discontinued in the 1970’s, and the original company went bankrupt in 1989 and was bought by TANG Industries of Gallatin, Tennessee.",

Working primarily in wood, he has created a body of work admirable for its intelligence, consistency, and economy of line. O’Toole’s sculptures, while modest in size, take on a monumental quality due to their visual mass and closed forms. He arrives at these forms not by the traditional subtractive carving but by a constructive process of laminating. \n\nThe final form must be visualized in advance and achieved in increments by laminating “slices” of the form. O’Toole will then sometimes sever a form into several units and by placement will allow the viewer to pass through a narrow channel. This interior/exterior dichotomy is emphasized by O’Toole with various materials, including ena.el, gesso, and metals. The careful application of one or more of these materials highlights the soft, organic curves echoed in his work from the natural environment.\n \n— Herbert Simon, Sculptor\n\nSelected Collections\n\nAzko, Inc.\nChesapeake Area Health Center\nCollege Misericordia\nConnaught Corporation\nHeinz Endowments\nMaslow Collection",

De Pree had been working at the company, which opened in 1905, since he was hired in 1909 as a clerk. De Pree knew his father-in-law was a man of integrity, so he decided to rename the company after him. \n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, the name Herman Miller had become synonymous with “modern” furniture. Working with legendary designers George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames, the company produced pieces that would become classics of industrial design.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Lee Reynolds Burr permitted the signature \"Lee Reynolds\" to be affixed to the best of the works conceived and executed at Vanguard Studios.

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

The big Yorkshire skies and endless vistas, changing colors and light through the seasons are a continuous inspiration for her mono-prints and her recent return to oils. \n\nShe moved to New York to start her new life, and seems very happy there. Initially her work sold at Liberty’s store gallery in London, then pieces were accepted for three separate Summer Exhibitions at the Royal Academy. Part-time teaching provided regular income, and left time to concentrate on painting. \n\nShe began doing large flower pictures, square paintings, very unusual at that time, and the gallery’s manager threw up her hands, saying that she couldn`t sell square paintings. But sell they did and when occasionally Romey sent in regular horizontal paintings, the same gallery manager objected. Apparently she had created a market demand for square paintings! \n\nWork by Romey T Brough can be seen currently at The Calder Gallery at Hebden Bridge, and at Pyramid Gallery in York.",

He designed a chair made of scrap iron he had fabricated by a blacksmith and that he wrapped with marine cord he purchased in the Embarcadero. This work was his first documented effort to bridge nature with architecture by creating a prototype of his indoor/outdoor furniture, and in the history of industrial design was a pivotal and revolutionary accomplishment. After Hendrik moved to Los Angeles in 1937, and met Taylor, they originally worked together on Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles, but moved in 1939 to Beverly Hills. In the early days they were a couple, but at some point they became business partners yet maintained an extremely close personal friendship/business partnership based on testimony from friends, and lived together with respective boyfriends in the same houses until the business closed in the early 1970s. In their shops they sold their own designs as well as accessories from other designers, notably Architectural Pottery, as they were personal friends with Max and Rita Lawrence.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Nelson studied architecture at Yale University in the 1920s, and in the next two decades earned a strong reputation as a writer on design for Architectural Forum, Interiors and Fortune.\n\nIn 1945 Nelson began a long association with the Herman Miller Furniture Company of Zeeland, Michigan, where as head designer he developed an innovative line of furniture and commissioned new designs from others. His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \n\nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \n\nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others.

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Their company was founded in 1963 by Fels and his brother-in-law Curtis (Kurt) Freiler. Freiler was the production chief and Fels was head of design. Their goal was to produce \"gallery-quality art for the masses\". Prior to the establishment of Artisan House, the partners built a costume jewellery business, selling work under the names Renoir and Matisse, which employed around 300 people at one point. Kurt and Jerry sold Artisan House in 1972. Kurt Freiler died July 22, 2013 at the age of 103.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame. \n \nDesigned in 1930 for the Tugendhat house in Brno, Czechoslovakia, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe`s Brno chair mirrors the groundbreaking simplicity of its original environment.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

This school of thought arose primarily in Scandinavian countries with contributions by Poul Henningsen, Alvar Aalto, and Arne Jacobsen.[1] In his lifetime he designed over 500 different chairs, over 100 of which were put into mass production and many of which have become recognizable design icons.\n\nWegner received several major design prizes, from the Lunning prize in 1951 and the Grand Prix of the Milan Triennale in the same year, to the Prince Eugen medal in Sweden and the Danish Eckersberg medal. In 1959, he was made honorary Royal designer for industry by the Royal Society of Arts in London.[4] His furniture is present in multiple international collection including the Museum of Modern Art in N.Y. \nand the Die Neue Samlung in Munich.",

His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \n\nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \n\nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers` college and many others.

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

They were employed as design consultants by Stag, the mass-market furniture manufacturer, and went on to design some iconic modern pieces. \n\nThe first project John and Sylvia Reid did for Stag was a bedroom suite called Cumberland, or the `C` range, which was strikingly minimalist. \n\nThey took functionalist principles to their logical conclusion and designed a range of furniture that was cheap to mass produce, but was of high quality. \n\nThere was no pretense that this new furniture was handmade by craftsmen it was built by machine and was meant to look like it. The units were stark, simply decorated, and recessed hand grips replaced handles on drawers and cupboards.\n\nStag advertised these pieces as being for \"the young in heart and in pocket\" - indeed, for designs of this quality, they were very inexpensive. \n\nDespite a slow start and doubts from Stag`s Chairman, Vaughn Radford, the line was \na commercial success and by 1957 it was earning more than £500,000 a year for the company. \n\nThe `C` range had a strong influence on the design of British mass market modern furniture throughout the Fifties.",

Using the consummate mid-century modern materials - like chrome, stainless, glass and leather - he created a new visual vocabulary, built on the legacy of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, but infused with the style and ease of the American West Coast. \nThe defining collaboration of his career, however, began in 1953 when he started working with Thayer Coggin, a North Carolina manufacturer that maintains its commitment classic design to this day. This partnership lasted five decades and produced enduring classics like the cantilevered 989-103 Chair and the semi-circular 825-301 LAF Sofa. In that time, Baughman never lost touch with his modernist foundation. In 1966, the New York Times said of the prolific designer: \"Mr. Baughman and the companies he works for…are among the few mass producers putting out inventive, non-traditional furniture that is widely available to the public both in terms of price and retail outlet.\"",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

        "field-2-value": "Bodil Kjaer \nKjær\"s furniture designs date mainly from 1959 to 1964. Her first assignment was an upholstered series for Paul Rudolph, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, who made the order for his Blue Cross Blue Shield tower in Boston, Massachusetts. She also provided designs for Josep Lluís Sert, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, for a Harvard University building. Marcel Breuer installed 28 of her upholstered sofas in a building he had designed in New York. Examples of her furniture can still be seen today at Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University. In notes she prepared in 1995 for an exhibition in Berlin, Kjær commented: \"I often ran into problems of finding furniture that would express the same form-ideas as those we employed in the buildings we designed and which would, at the same time, express the ideas of contemporary management. The office furniture I found on the market in 1959, I found to be clumsy and confining, while neither the new architecture nor the new management thinking was the least bit clumsy or confining.\" \n\nHer working table (1959) was designed as part of a flexible working environment. The prototype, in ashwood with a matte, chrome plated base, was made for Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A model in walnut was made for Wellesley College. In addition to the table with its four inset drawers, Kjær designed a number of storage items with adjustable shelves and drawers which could be placed under the table or beside a wall. \n\nThe table has been used widely in films (From Russia with Love) and on television (BBC election broadcasts) as well as by celebrities including Prince Phillip (at Sandringham), the actor Michael Caine, and the pianist Oscar Peterson. In the 1960s, the table and storage elements were manufactured by E. Pedersen & Søn in Rødovre, Denmark as well as in Boston. But production terminated in 1974 when one manufacturer went bankrupt and another suffered fire damage. Some of her office units and upholstered designs were reissued between 2007 and 2009 by Hothouse Design in Shanghai but production has now ceased. Today her furniture is auctioned at increasingly high prices.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

These exercises culminated with the much lauded 40/4 Chair, designed in 1963 and was immediately awarded the grand prize at the prestigous Milan Triennale the next year. \nDavid Rowland went on to design numerous other chairs that satisfy the rigorous demands of mass production while retaining a high level of design sophistication, but the 40/4 chair has never been surpassed, by Rowland or others.",

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

He set up shop on New York`s Madison Avenue in 1936 and proceeded to design houses from coast to coast for such famous people as tobacco heiress Doris Duke, Alfred A. Knopf and Thelma Chrysler Foy. \"He was successful at mixing classical elements from ancient Greece and the Art Deco period in a modern way that appealed to American tastes,\" says Paris dealer Eric Philippe. \n\nOne of the designer`s most important residential commissions was Hilda Boldt Weber`s mansion Casa Encantada in Bel-Air. Creating more than 200 pieces of furniture for that house between 1934 and 1938, Robsjohn-Gibbings indulged his passion for Greco-Roman design by incorporating sphinxes, dolphins, lions` paw feet and Ionic columns in table bases and select pieces of furniture, nonetheless keeping the interior design simple and elegant. Casa Encantada survived its sale to Conrad Hilton in 1952, but its next owner, David Murdoch, stripped the house of what was called \"opulent simplicity\" and auctioned off the contents in the early 1980s. \n\nSince then pieces come up for sale every once in a while, mostly in the United States, making Philippe`s offering a significant one. Highlights include a pair of gilt-wood  whose fluted shafts are guarded by three carved maple doves, a console table consisting of a carved open-winged griffin supporting an ash-and-burr top and a pair of wall lamps carved in a Chinese Art Deco style, which the dealer is showing alongside other 1930s and `40s Robsjohn-Gibbings designs, such as a pair of oversized armchairs perched on horn-shaped blond mahogany feet and upholstered in yellow hand-woven wool.",

Working closely with the factory`s glassblowers his work became widely known for its use of bright colours that were vividly seen in his Pop glasses of 1966. He was awarded the prestigious Lunning Prize in the same year. Following a period as artistic director at the company he returned to his home town of Gävle in 1970 and began designing for Dansk International, a firm with a high reputation for Scandinavian tableware. In 1973 he once more took up silversmithing, establishing a studio and shop and from 1976 worked for Orrefors on a freelance basis.",

During the war they were commissioned by the Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports. This Tandem Sling Seating is still in use in airports around the world today.",

An emphasis on details, a love of materials and an intimate understanding of the human body combine in Mians designs to transform them beyond the ordinary. \n\nA long and diverse course of training brought Mian to furniture design. Schooled as an architect at the University of Venice, Mian worked on the restoration of old buildings before moving on to exhibition design, historical research and then industrial and furniture design. This varied background is brought to bear in every project Mian undertakes. In his furniture, one can see a respect for history, an understanding of spatial dynamics and a finesse of presentation. In Mians best-known works, such as the Baba seating collection, a mix of style and practicality is ensured through expert construction, use of durable and attractive materials and, most important, a deep understanding of how the human body interacts with its surroundings. Although it may look streamlined and minimal, Mians Baba seating expertly and comfortably cradles the body where it needs it the most; the reduction of parts does not infer a reductive aesthetic at work but simply expert knowledge of the body in repose. In Mians work, less indeed is more.",

In 1926 they published their manifesto “Five Points Towards a New Architecture” which served as the backbone for their architectural aesthetic. The Villa Savoye .1928-1931. serves as a representation for their outlined ideology. An elegant building predominantly made out of glass with an almost undivided interior and columns, which made it look as if it was floating above the ground. \nIn 1929 at the Paris Salon d’Automne, Jeanneret unveiled a set of modern furniture designed in collaboration with Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand. Included were tubular steel chairs, stools and a set of modular steel storage units. \nJeanneret\"s contribution to the partnership was considerable, not least in introducing professionalism in following through projects and work on site - he often stimulated and provoked his cousin’s imagination or moderated it with his own realism. He frequently drew the first sketches for plans that he then gradually reworked and refined with Le Corbusier, playing an important part in ensuring the office’s continuity, coordinating work and maintaining tight control over all the technical aspects. \nPierre Jeanneret, in collaboration with the English husband-wife team of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, was responsible for much of the planned city of Chandigarh\"s .in India.huge civic architecture project. Pierre was responsible for a significant amount of designing for the Panjab University, including the Gandhi Bhawan and the University Library. Pierre Jeanneret stayed on in Chandigarh after its construction, advising the local government in his appointed capacity as Chief Architect of the city. He lived in the city for fifteen years, and had his ashes scattered in Chandigarh\"s central lake.",

His uniquely American designs were forward-thinking and distinctive, yet unpretentious and affordable. His prolific and highly influential work continues to be copied, reinvented and revived in the new and secondary decorative arts markets by contemporary furniture designers and dealers alike. Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies starting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch Gordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and Drexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.",

He was among the first to introduce modernist ideas to Denmark and create industrial furniture that built upon on its craft-based design heritage.\n\nDuring the 1960`s, Jacobsen`s most important work was a unified architectural and interior design scheme for St. Catherine`s College, Oxford, which, like his earlier work for the Royal Hotel, involved the design of site-specific furniture. Jacobsen`s work remains appealing and fresh today, combining free-form sculptural shapes with the traditional attributes of Scandinavian design, material and structural integrity.",

In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \n\nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory (1947-1948) along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \n\nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers\" college and many others.

He got his professional start working in some of the most prominent and interesting architecture practices in the country. Between 1945 and 1950 he worked for Raymond Loewy and I.M. Pei. He was a part of Eero Saarinen`s office from 1960-65, participating in the designs for the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C., the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center and several dormitories at Yale University. It was after this extensive exposure to many innovative modern designers of the period, and having gathered a great deal of experience, that Platner opened his own office, Platner Associates, in Connecticut in 1967. \n\nPlatner designed other office furniture and was also involved in a number of large architecture and interior design commissions in which he was often responsible for details down to the dishes and textiles, in addition to the furniture and textiles.",

Frankl (October 14, 1886 – March 21, 1958) \nAn Art Deco furniture designer and maker, architect, painter and writer from Vienna, Austria, was the son of a wealthy real estate speculator. \n\nAfter Frankl completed his architectural studies at the Berlin Polytechnic, he traveled, spending time in Berlin and Copenhagen before arriving in the United States in April 1914. He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism. \nIn the 1920s, he introduced his celebrated skyscraper style (before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s). Frankl opened Frankl Galleries on 48th Street, calling his company Skyscraper Furniture, which became an epicenter of American modernism, including modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe. \nHis solo art shows included New York City\"s Knoedler Gallery in 1931 and Los Angeles\"s Stendahl Gallery in 1944. \nAfter he later relocated to Los Angeles and opened a gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, celebrities such as Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Walter Huston and Alfred Hitchcock became clients. \nFrankl wrote several books and magazine articles about the Modern Style and was its most vocal proponent. He later designed production pieces for Brown Saltman of California and Johnson Furniture Company of Grand Rapids, incorporating an early use of biomorphic designs and novel materials such as cork veneer. His style continuously evolved, from early skyscraper furniture to relaxed and casual designs favored by the Hollywood elite in the 1930s to manufactured pieces for the mass market in the 1950s. In 1934 he moved to Los Angeles where he taught at the University of Southern California and the Chouinard Art Institute. Used, out-of-print books he authored sell for hundreds of dollars in online bookstores.",

Long fascinated by the relationship between materials, technology, design, and function -- and given to flights of insightful socio-cultural and philosophical musings -- Kramer is recognized as one of the greatest industrial designers of our age. A graduate of the renowned engineering program at Chicago\"s Institute of Design, his achievements were myriad. Kramer devised the first truly ergonomic chair in 1946; began conceiving radically new truck designs in the early-1950s; started teaching Industrial Design at the University of Washington in 1957 and architecture workshops at the University of Oregon in 1960. In 1966 the American Institute of Architects (AIA) honored his \"outstanding achievement in fine arts, allied professions, [and] craftsmanship in the industrial arts\" by bestowing on him their coveted Industrial Arts Medal. \nKramer\"s probable greatest claim to fame was his famous and award-winning ION chair. An icon of mid-century modern furniture design, the ultra-ergonomic chair was a result of his philosophic approach to design. As Kramer told The Seattle Times in 1966, the design came about because he simply viewed the act of sitting as a \"dynamic rather than static condition.\"",

He settled in New York City and brought with him an outsider’s fresh perspective and an enthusiasm for forging a uniquely American design aesthetic. Frankl began as an architect and later switched to designing and painting fine art and furniture. In the years between the two world wars he, more than any other designer, helped shape the distinctive look of American modernism. \nIn the 1920s, he introduced his celebrated skyscraper style (before turning to metal furnishings in the 1930s). Frankl opened Frankl Galleries on 48th Street, calling his company Skyscraper Furniture, which became an epicenter of American modernism, including modern textiles and wallpapers imported from Europe. \nHis solo art shows included New York City's Knoedler Gallery in 1931 and Los Angeles's Stendahl Gallery in 1944. \nAfter he later relocated to Los Angeles and opened a gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, celebrities such as Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Walter Huston and Alfred Hitchcock became clients. \n\nFrankl wrote several books and magazine articles about the Modern Style and was its most vocal proponent. He later designed production pieces for Brown Saltman of California and Johnson Furniture Company of Grand Rapids, incorporating an early use of biomorphic designs and novel materials such as cork veneer.[3] His style continuously evolved, from early skyscraper furniture to relaxed and casual designs favored by the Hollywood elite in the 1930s to manufactured pieces for the mass market in the 1950s. In 1934 he moved to Los Angeles where he taught at the University of Southern California and the Chouinard Art Institute. Used, out-of-print books he authored sell for hundreds of dollars in online bookstores.",

The Barcelona studio designed exhibition stands for Perobell and the SIDI group in 1984. \n\nDuring the 1980`s Pensi was prolific in producing new designs for lighting and furniture and became widely known for his fluid, elegant chair designs. His cast-aluminum Toledo chair won numerous prizes in Europe, including the First Award Selection from SIDI, Silver Delta Awards from the Assoziazione del Diesegno Industriale and a Design-Auswal 90 Award from the Stuttgart Design Center. The Orfilia chair, designed for Thonet, and Pensi`s Olympia lamp for B. Lux came to exemplify Spanish design during this decade. \n\nIn 1994, Pensi designed the exhibition Salon Internacionale de Diseno para el Habitat. One of Spain`s leading designers today, Pensi has worked internationally as a design consultant and created furniture for a wide range of fine manufacturers. His work for Kron, one of the finest furniture manufacturers in the U.S., includes the dramatic Pensi Lounge Chair and Couch.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

He creates his figures using a moldable epoxy resin that changes as it dries, adding an unexpected element beyond the artist’s control.

Long fascinated by the relationship between materials, technology, design, and function -- and given to flights of insightful socio-cultural and philosophical musings -- Kramer is recognized as one of the greatest industrial designers of our age. A graduate of the renowned engineering program at Chicago\"s Institute of Design, his achievements were myriad. Kramer devised the first truly ergonomic chair in 1946; began conceiving radically new truck designs in the early-1950s; started teaching Industrial Design at the University of Washington in 1957 and architecture workshops at the University of Oregon in 1960. In 1966 the American Institute of Architects (AIA) honored his \"outstanding achievement in fine arts, allied professions, [and] craftsmanship in the industrial arts\" by bestowing on him their coveted Industrial Arts Medal. \nKramer\"s probable greatest claim to fame was his famous and award-winning ION chair. An icon of mid-century modern furniture design, the ultra-ergonomic chair was a result of his philosophic approach to design. As Kramer told The Seattle Times in 1966, the design came about because he simply viewed the act of sitting as a \"dynamic rather than static condition.\"",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n\nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n\nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Accordingly, he works each item of furniture from the drawing board, through his own shop where he handled the raw materials directly, to actual use in his New York home with wife, Charlotte, and two young sons. As a partner in Post Modern, Ltd., which manufactured from his designs. Arthur had a hand in producing, merchandising, and selling, too. \n\nSome of his most interesting pieces are those which combine wrought iron and wood or laminated plastic: well sized desk (36x24x45), in birch, walnut or Formica; combination lamp table and magazine rack in the same materials. \n\nHis most recognizable early work designs were for Shaver Howard. \n\nUmanoff`s work for Elton continues with the introduction of chairs, serving carts and a complete line of case pieces which get Elton and Umanoff chosen for the 1953 Good Design Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. \n\nThe Umanoff designs for Elton (1953) were also featured for the 1954 Storage: Volume 4 of the Interiors Library series edited by George Nelson.",

Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe.

Scarpa and his wife Afra collaborated on many projects and would eventually work for many international companies including Knoll and Cassina. After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \n\nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material.

Like other Scandinavian designers such as Josef Frank and Kaare Klint, Risom continued to honor tradition in modern design, combining old and new in highly original ways. \n\nJens Risom`s career has spanned nearly sixty years. He began his study of design in the Copehagen workshop of Kaare Klint in 1935 and joined Ernst Kuhn`s architectural office in 1938, where he designed furniture and interiors. In 1939, Risom emigrated to the U.S. and in 1941 designed the first chair manufactured by Knoll. Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

His first commission was Isamu Noguchi\"s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson\"s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World\"s Fair.",

        "field-2-value": "Jim Peed --1930-Present-- Peed grew up in Indiana, and was the fourth son born to his family. \n“George was born in 1913, William in 1915, Orion in 1916, and I came along in 1930,” he said. “My dad was upset.” \nPeed went nameless for some days before his father was told the child needed a name. \n“Call it Jim,” said Peed of his father’s pronouncement. “Just Jim, not James.” His other brothers had middle names, he said. \nPeed and his wife, Gretchen, met in high school in Indianapolis and dated for the next 59 years, he said of their relationship. She was from a prominent family, and was highly intelligent, he said. \n“She was notified by Bryn Mawr where she went to school that she had scored the highest SATs in English in the history of the school,” he said. “She majored in math because she wouldn’t have to do homework or write papers. She wanted to get through college the easy way.” \nPeed and Gretchen married in June 1951. Gretchen had not completed Bryn Mawr, and Peed was still in school at Indiana University. \n“Her mother’s friends said it wouldn’t last six months,” he said. She had not graduated from Bryn Mawr, and he was enrolled at Indiana University studying for a fine art degree. At the time she had a job at the university and he was working in a filling station. \nPeed’s journey to success began when he designed his first chair. A friend saw it and invited him to work in Jackson Square in San Francisco. \n“It was a refurbished group of foreign embassies,” he said. “The square was filled with wholesale decorator shops, and someone let me use their showroom to take a photograph of my chair.” \nThe uniqueness of the way the shot was staged, with background décor and lighting, was enough for the Los Angeles Times and a major San Francisco newspaper (he could not recall which) to feature the photograph in the home furnishing sections of each paper. \n“A salesman from Hickory Manufacturing saw one of the articles and called me,” he said. “They asked me to design a line for the company.” \nAfter a year and a half at Hickory, Peed designed a brochure that was shot by Alderman’s Studios. Alderman’s used the brochure to advertise the quality of their work, and Drexel took note. \n“When I went to work for Drexel I was 30, and by 35 I was on the company’s board of directors and vice president of marketing, in charge of product, showrooms, advertising and public relations,” he said. \nAsked about being in the right place at the right time, Peed responded it was luck, but he also said that people create their own luck with hard work. \n“Having the combination of a dirty name and an ugly face, I ended up in print a lot,” he said. He then told of an instance when Time magazine came to interview his boss at Drexel. \n“The reporter spent two hours with him. Then he introduced me to the reporter. We were introducing a big ottoman – about 4-feet square. I said the nickname for the piece was the ‘orgiastic ottoman.’ My boss received not one quote in the interview, which talked about me and the nickname,” Peed said. \nPeed later opened up his own business, which also flourished. He became associated with Flat Rock Furniture out of Indiana, and worked with founder Van McQueen in developing a high-end of bent wood furniture using Hickory saplings. \n“When we retained Jim he took us in a new direction,” said McQueen. “He would say this is not just fishing camp furniture. We were able to reach a broader, more sophisticated clientele. It’s very safe to say we would not have gotten to the level of sophistication without Jim.” \nPeed had first designed a Hickory sapling dining chair for a Hickory manufacturer. McQueen said the company decided not to go in that direction, and he told Peed he liked the chair. He got permission to produce it, and brought Peed on to design an entire line, called the Jonas Ridge Collection. \nThe original dining room chair, called the JP 812, has sold continuously for 20 years.",

An emphasis on details, a love of materials and an intimate understanding of the human body combine in Mians designs to transform them beyond the ordinary. \n\nA long and diverse course of training brought Mian to furniture design. Schooled as an architect at the University of Venice, Mian worked on the restoration of old buildings before moving on to exhibition design, historical research and then industrial and furniture design. This varied background is brought to bear in every project Mian undertakes. In his furniture, one can see a respect for history, an understanding of spatial dynamics and a finesse of presentation. In Mians best-known works, such as the Baba seating collection, a mix of style and practicality is ensured through expert construction, use of durable and attractive materials and, most important, a deep understanding of how the human body interacts with its surroundings. Although it may look streamlined and minimal, Mians Baba seating expertly and comfortably cradles the body where it needs it the most; the reduction of parts does not infer a reductive aesthetic at work but simply expert knowledge of the body in repose. In Mians work, less indeed is more.",

Working closely with the factory`s glassblowers his work became widely known for its use of bright colours that were vividly seen in his Pop glasses of 1966. He was awarded the prestigious Lunning Prize in the same year. Following a period as artistic director at the company he returned to his home town of Gävle in 1970 and began designing for Dansk International, a firm with a high reputation for Scandinavian tableware. In 1973 he once more took up silversmithing, establishing a studio and shop and from 1976 worked for Orrefors on a freelance basis.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household na.e for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

Dunbar used exotic wood veneers and many two-toned wood combinations.

Kazuhide Takahama is, however, primarily known as a furniture and lighting designer. Kazuhide Takahama met furniture-maker Dino Gavina in Milan in 1957 and remained in Italy to design for Gavina\"s firm. Kazuhide Takahama\"s designs are distinguished by clarity of line and form, qualities that reveal his Japanese origins. He often combines traditional forms and techniques with Western elements in his designs. In 1957 Kazuhide Takahama designed the \"Naeko\" sofa bed for Gavina. In 1965 Kazuhide Takahama created \"Marcel\", \"Suzanne\", and \"Raymond\", seat furniture named after Marcel Breuer and his brother and sister. These Kazuhide Takahama pieces are made of large blocks of polyurethane foam in various combinations. A seating system on similar lines is \"ESA\", which Kazuhide Takahama designed in 1968. \"ESA\", however, is composed of hexagonal blocks of foam plastic, which can be assembled as desired or simply stacked. For Sirrah, Kazuhide Takahama designed \"Kazuki\" (1975), which can be either a floor lamp or table lamp. Its wire frame is covered in stretchable white jersey, a reminder that this is an adaption of the South-East Asian rice-paper lantern. In 1961 Kazuhide Takahama designed \"Gea\", a semicircular shelving system with lacquer-coated wood. The 1971 Kazuhide Takahama \"Kazuki\" chair is also made of straight, lacquered boards although the seat is leather-covered. In 1968 Kazuhide Takahama designed \"Acca\", a table with a glass top and aprons and substructure of black lacquered wood. In 1970 Kazuhide Takahama created the \"Olinto\" line in lacquer furniture for B&B Italia.",

From 1920 to 1928 he was a student and teacher at Germany’s Bauhaus, a school of design where modern principles, technologies and the application of new materials were encouraged in both the industrial and fine arts. \n\nAfter completing his studies at the Bauhaus, Breuer traveled to Paris, where he worked in an architect’s office. After a year he was appointed as head of the carpentry workshop at the Bauhaus. Breuer was given the title of \"young master\".",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household na.e for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

Wormley attended the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926. After attending there he worked for Marshall Field`s Design Studio in 1930, and then a year later he began working for Dunbar. His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

They included Marilyn Monroe, Xavier Cugat, Lily Pons, Gary Cooper, Sherman Fairchild of Fairchild Aviation, Walt Disney, General Electric, Monsanto, General Motors, Prudential Insurance, and the Government of Venezuela. \n\nConnoisseurs and museums are avidly collecting his designs today.

In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Later, he founded the furniture factory J.L Møller Møbelfabrik in Århus, Denmark, in 1944. \n\nIn 1946, the first chair, aptly titled No. 1, was developed, and over the next 13 years, with furniture being shipped as far as the US, J.L. Møllers Møbelfabrik was pressured to move to new and bigger premises on L.A. Ringsvej in Højbjerg, on the outskirts of Århus. \n\nMøller designed the No. 71 chair in 1951 and it became one of his most popular designs. He went on to design other dining chairs and tables, coffee tables, sideboards and cabinets and serving carts but the No. 78 chair, launched in 1962, is considered his most impressive design, its subtle and elegant features rendering it a standard for design and quality of production. \n\nIn 1981, Møller’s company received the Dansk MøbelIndustri’s Furniture Prize.

His collaboration with Dunbar made him a household name for decades. \n\nHis first Dunbar chairs, produced in 1932, were reproductions of antique designs, but when they became popular Wormley augmented the set with new pieces to form a full line of furniture for almost every room in the house. He was given a contract under which he would produce two lines of furniture each year, one traditional and one modern. By 1944, however, the popularity of the modern line had eclipsed its counterpart and the traditional series was dropped. He opened his own office in New York a year later where he remained a consultant for Dunbar and contracted out his own designs. Wormley`s designs became a special mark of distinction and one can see the great care put into preserving the old with the new.",

The big Yorkshire skies and endless vistas, changing colors and light through the seasons are a continuous inspiration for her mono-prints and her recent return to oils. \n\nShe moved to New York to start her new life, and seems very happy there. Initially her work sold at Liberty’s store gallery in London, then pieces were accepted for three separate Summer Exhibitions at the Royal Academy. Part-time teaching provided regular income, and left time to concentrate on painting. \n\nShe began doing large flower pictures, square paintings, very unusual at that time, and the gallery’s manager threw up her hands, saying that she couldn`t sell square paintings. But sell they did and when occasionally Romey sent in regular horizontal paintings, the same gallery manager objected. Apparently she had created a market demand for square paintings! \n\nWork by Romey T Brough can be seen currently at The Calder Gallery at Hebden Bridge, and at Pyramid Gallery in York.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

His body of designs included furniture, jewelry, glass, lighting and office machine design. In 1981, Sottsass and an international group of young architects and designers came together to form the Memphis Group. A night of drinking and listening to Bob Dylan\"s \"Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again\" gave the group its na.e. Memphis was launched with a collection of 40 pieces of furniture, ceramics, lighting, glass and textiles which featured fluorescent colors, slick surfaces, intentionally lop-sided shapes and squiggly laminate patterns. The group\"s colorful, ironic pieces were hailed as one of the most characteristic examples of Post-modernism in design and the arts. \nAs an industrial designer, his clients included Fiorucci, Esprit, the Italian furniture company Poltronova, Knoll International, Serafino Zani, Alessi and Brondi. As an architect, he designed the Mayer-Schwarz Gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, with its dramatic doorway made of irregular folds and jagged angles, and the home of David M. Kelley, designer of Apple\"s first computer mouse, in Woodside, California. In the mid-1990s he designed the sculpture garden and entry gates of the W. Keith and Janet Kellogg Gallery at the campus of Cal Poly Pomona. He collaborated with well known figures in the architecture and design field, including Aldo Cibic, James Irvine, Matteo Thun. \nSottsass had a vast body of work; furniture, jewellery, ceramics, glass, silver work, lighting, office machine design and buildings which inspired generations of architects and designers. In 2006 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held the first major museum survey exhibition of his work in the United States. A retrospective exhibition, Ettore Sottsass: Work in Progress, was held at the Design Museum in London in 2007. In 2009, the Marres Centre for Contemporary Culture in Maastricht presented a re-construction of a Sottsass\" exhibition \"Miljö för en ny planet\" .Landscape for a new planet., which took place in the National Museum in Stockholm in 1969. One of his works, Telefono Enorme designed for Brondi, is part of the MOMA Collection.",

He also has had tables that climb walls instead of being centered in the room. Arad`s works are often worked into distinctive biomorphic shapes and are created from his medium of choice, steel. He made plans to expand his studio in 2008. \nIn 2008, he designed the Bauhaus Museum in Tel Aviv. \nIn 2008–09, Arad paired with KENZO to create his first perfume bottle. The bottle was on display in his exhibit No Discipline. \nHe has also designed the Design Museum Holon together with Bruno Asa, which was opened in Israel in 2010. \nIn 2010, Arad started his collaboration with New Eye London to design an eyewear collection.

        "field-2-value": "Jim Peed --1930-Present-- Peed grew up in Indiana, and was the fourth son born to his family. \n“George was born in 1913, William in 1915, Orion in 1916, and I came along in 1930,” he said. “My dad was upset.” \nPeed went nameless for some days before his father was told the child needed a name. \n“Call it Jim,” said Peed of his father’s pronouncement. “Just Jim, not James.” His other brothers had middle names, he said. \nPeed and his wife, Gretchen, met in high school in Indianapolis and dated for the next 59 years, he said of their relationship. She was from a prominent family, and was highly intelligent, he said. \n“She was notified by Bryn Mawr where she went to school that she had scored the highest SATs in English in the history of the school,” he said. “She majored in math because she wouldn’t have to do homework or write papers. She wanted to get through college the easy way.” \nPeed and Gretchen married in June 1951. Gretchen had not completed Bryn Mawr, and Peed was still in school at Indiana University. \n“Her mother’s friends said it wouldn’t last six months,” he said. She had not graduated from Bryn Mawr, and he was enrolled at Indiana University studying for a fine art degree. At the time she had a job at the university and he was working in a filling station. \nPeed’s journey to success began when he designed his first chair. A friend saw it and invited him to work in Jackson Square in San Francisco. \n“It was a refurbished group of foreign embassies,” he said. “The square was filled with wholesale decorator shops, and someone let me use their showroom to take a photograph of my chair.” \nThe uniqueness of the way the shot was staged, with background décor and lighting, was enough for the Los Angeles Times and a major San Francisco newspaper (he could not recall which) to feature the photograph in the home furnishing sections of each paper. \n“A salesman from Hickory Manufacturing saw one of the articles and called me,” he said. “They asked me to design a line for the company.” \nAfter a year and a half at Hickory, Peed designed a brochure that was shot by Alderman’s Studios. Alderman’s used the brochure to advertise the quality of their work, and Drexel took note. \n“When I went to work for Drexel I was 30, and by 35 I was on the company’s board of directors and vice president of marketing, in charge of product, showrooms, advertising and public relations,” he said. \nAsked about being in the right place at the right time, Peed responded it was luck, but he also said that people create their own luck with hard work. \n“Having the combination of a dirty name and an ugly face, I ended up in print a lot,” he said. He then told of an instance when Time magazine came to interview his boss at Drexel. \n“The reporter spent two hours with him. Then he introduced me to the reporter. We were introducing a big ottoman about 4-feet square. I said the nickname for the piece was the ‘orgiastic ottoman.’ My boss received not one quote in the interview, which talked about me and the nickname,” Peed said. \nPeed later opened up his own business, which also flourished. He became associated with Flat Rock Furniture out of Indiana, and worked with founder Van McQueen in developing a high-end of bent wood furniture using Hickory saplings. \n“When we retained Jim he took us in a new direction,” said McQueen. “He would say this is not just fishing camp furniture. We were able to reach a broader, more sophisticated clientele. It’s very safe to say we would not have gotten to the level of sophistication without Jim.” \nPeed had first designed a Hickory sapling dining chair for a Hickory manufacturer. McQueen said the company decided not to go in that direction, and he told Peed he liked the chair. He got permission to produce it, and brought Peed on to design an entire line, called the Jonas Ridge Collection. \nThe original dining room chair, called the JP 812, has sold continuously for 20 years.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

An innovator at the vanguard of modern design. Lee combines rational thinking with radical influences to create minimalist pieces with deft whimsical touches. Upon obtaining a degree in industrial design, Lee began his career in Chicago with notable furniture manufacturers and design studios. Relocating to Milan, he then honed his distinctive artistic style seen in his work today Incorporating minimal principles of Bauhaus with experience he gained collaborating at the irreverent Studio Alchimia, Lee nurtured a unique aesthetic that is both vibrant and charismatic. After more than 15 years of multi-disciplinary exploration in San Francisco, Chicago, and Milan, Lee and his team now design for major furniture manufacturers and independent clients including, Bonaldo, Magis, Surface Magazine, American Leather, DWR, San Francisco Opera Guild, Shanghai MoCA and Viken. His work has appeared in movie sets and in celebrity homes of Bruce Willis and Michael Jordon. Lee`s designs have also been widely exhibited internationally and reviewed in notable publications such as the New York Times, Metropolitan Home, Surface Magazine, Case De Abitare, ID. Metropolis, lnterni and Dwell. Lee`s theoretical approach to design hinges on the tactics of an actor. Working with a wide range of materials and resources, he prefers not to work with any one particular material on a consistent basis. Lee considers \"California cuisine\" an apt metaphor for his work—a mix of seemingly incongruent ingredients carefully combined to create something new and fresh. \n\nRick Lee shares his San Francisco design studio with his wife, fashion designer Colleen Quen from whom he draws much of his inspiration, and with whom he often collaborates.",

In 1923 he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä, where he was joined by Aino Marsio after their marriage in 1924. \n\nFrom 1946-1948 he taught at MIT, where he designed Baker House, a student dormitory .1947-1948. along the Charles River. It was his largest commission in a dozen years, and one of his first challenges in urban design. \n\nIn the post war years he added city planning to his activities, as Finland repaired the damage sustained in World War II, resettled people who had lived in ceded areas, and its growing population became rapidly urbanized. To this period belong his design for the civic center of Säynätsalo, the National Pension Institute, the Academic Book Store in Helsinki, the Jyväskylä teachers\" college and many others. During his lifetime, his office produced over 300 buildings and projects.",

Born in Budapest in 1891, Anton Lorenz was teaching history and geography in his hometown up until 1919. After his wife, an opera singer, had found an engagement in Leipzig, he moved to Germany. Anton Lorenz had been working in the locking business in Leipzig before he moved to Berlin in 1927, where he met Kalman Lengyel, who was looking for production facilities for Marcel Breuer`s designs, with whom he had just founded the company \"Standard Möbel\" (Standard Furniture). The two business- and fellow countrymen soon found an agreement, and Anton Lorenz produced Breuer`s designs in his own metal workshop and was also business manager of \"Standard Möbel\". \nAnton Lorenz, who obviously had the right touch in businnes, was always looking for new sources of income. He was interested in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe`s cantilever chair. After van der Rohe had rejected Anton Lorenz`s offer for a joint venture, he turned to Mart Stam in 1929, who was the inventor of the cantilever chair without rear legs. Anton Lorenz acquired the rights for Stam`s chair and started his own company \"DESTA\" (Deutsche Stahlmöbel-German Steel Furniture). \"Standard Möbel\" was taken over by the company \"Thonet\" the same year. \nAfter numerous law suits over the copyrights for the cantilever chair that Lorenz had initiated and successfully managed, he gave all rights in the product range of \"DESTA\" to \"Thonet\", where he was appointed head of the legal department at the same time. \nHowever, Anton Lorenz was not only a businessman: In the 1920s he was also designing steel tube furniture. The steel tube divan with waxed thread covering \"LS 22\" from 1931 is his most famous design. The elegant minimalist piece was at first produced by \"DESTA\", but soon after by \"Thonet\". A re-edition of the modern classic was launched by Thornet in 2006. After the lawsuits over the cantilever chair had been won by Anton Lorenz, he tried to claim further patents and marketing rights for trend-setting designs. He acquired, for instance, the licenses for stackable chairs after designs by Mart Stam, Alvar Aalto and Bruno Pollak in 1953. \nHe went on a business trip to Paris in 1939, the same time World War II broke out. In the face of the political situation, Lorenz decided not to return to Germany and tried to gain a foothold overseas, staying in the furniture and patent business up until his death in Greenwich/Connecticut in 1964.",

In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eameses` molded plywood furniture. Their molded plywood chair was called \"the chair of the century\" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956. Sturdy, comfortable and elegant office furniture was created in the 1960s, as well as seating designed for Dulles and O`Hare Airports.

Kazuhide Takahama is, however, primarily known as a furniture and lighting designer. Kazuhide Takahama met furniture-maker Dino Gavina in Milan in 1957 and remained in Italy to design for Gavina\"s firm. Kazuhide Takahama\"s designs are distinguished by clarity of line and form, qualities that reveal his Japanese origins. He often combines traditional forms and techniques with Western elements in his designs. In 1957 Kazuhide Takahama designed the \"Naeko\" sofa bed for Gavina. In 1965 Kazuhide Takahama created \"Marcel\", \"Suzanne\", and \"Raymond\", seat furniture named after Marcel Breuer and his brother and sister. These Kazuhide Takahama pieces are made of large blocks of polyurethane foam in various combinations. A seating system on similar lines is \"ESA\", which Kazuhide Takahama designed in 1968. \"ESA\", however, is composed of hexagonal blocks of foam plastic, which can be assembled as desired or simply stacked. For Sirrah, Kazuhide Takahama designed \"Kazuki\" (1975), which can be either a floor lamp or table lamp. Its wire frame is covered in stretchable white jersey, a reminder that this is an adaption of the South-East Asian rice-paper lantern. In 1961 Kazuhide Takahama designed \"Gea\", a semicircular shelving system with lacquer-coated wood. The 1971 Kazuhide Takahama \"Kazuki\" chair is also made of straight, lacquered boards although the seat is leather-covered. In 1968 Kazuhide Takahama designed \"Acca\", a table with a glass top and aprons and substructure of black lacquered wood. In 1970 Kazuhide Takahama created the \"Olinto\" line in lacquer furniture for B&B Italia.",

After doing glassworks he and his wife designed metal collages of steel and leather. In 1960, they opened their own office in Montebellana and began designing furniture like their famous Chair Model 917 that was manufactured by Cassina. \n \nMany of their pieces were built on the appreciation of materials and using modern materials while still creating pieces that had comfort and elegance. Their \"Bastiano\" set-- couch, lounge chair, tables- were designed for Gavina and later reissued by Knoll. This set became an icon of this design philosophy and became one of the best selling pieces of its time. He also designed the \"Coronado\" series of armchairs and the \"Soriana\" chair that was featured at the New Domestic Landscape show in 1972 at MOMA. Scarpa and his wife also worked in commercial architecture and interior design later on, and designed interiors for companies like Benetton clothing.",

His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

In the mid-1920s, he began to design furniture, pieces that he conceived and created for particular interiors. In 1927, he met Lilly Reich, a Bauhaus alumnus who collaborated with Mies on his first versions of a cantilevered chair with a tubular steel frame. The cantilevered chair had a curved frame that exploited the aesthetic, as well as the structural possibilities of this material. Their experiments culminated in the virtuoso Brno chair designed between 1929 and 1930 with a chromed flat steel frame.",

Her first assignment was an upholstered series for Paul Rudolph, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, who made the order for his Blue Cross Blue Shield tower in Boston, Massachusetts. She also provided designs for Josep Lluís Sert, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, for a Harvard University building. Marcel Breuer installed 28 of her upholstered sofas in a building he had designed in New York. Examples of her furniture can still be seen today at Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University. In notes she prepared in 1995 for an exhibition in Berlin, Kjær commented: \"I often ran into problems of finding furniture that would express the same form-ideas as those we employed in the buildings we designed and which would, at the same time, express the ideas of contemporary management. The office furniture I found on the market in 1959, I found to be clumsy and confining, while neither the new architecture nor the new management thinking was the least bit clumsy or confining.\" \n\nHer working table (1959) was designed as part of a flexible working environment. The prototype, in ashwood with a matte, chrome plated base, was made for Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A model in walnut was made for Wellesley College. In addition to the table with its four inset drawers, Kjær designed a number of storage items with adjustable shelves and drawers which could be placed under the table or beside a wall. \n\nThe table has been used widely in films (From Russia with Love) and on television (BBC election broadcasts) as well as by celebrities including Prince Phillip (at Sandringham), the actor Michael Caine, and the pianist Oscar Peterson. In the 1960s, the table and storage elements were manufactured by E. Pedersen & Søn in Rødovre, Denmark as well as in Boston. But production terminated in 1974 when one manufacturer went bankrupt and another suffered fire damage. Some of her office units and upholstered designs were reissued between 2007 and 2009 by Hothouse Design in Shanghai but production has now ceased. Today her furniture is auctioned at increasingly high prices.",

His first commission was Isamu Noguchi`s biomorphic glass-topped coffee table, which began production in 1947, the first of many designs that the sculptor would create for Herman Miller in the late Forties. Nelson also was responsible for bringing the designs of Charles Eames to Herman Miller, and he collaborated with R. Buckminster Fuller on a number of projects. \n\nAmong Nelson`s own creations are classic works of Fifties design, including the bubble lamp, ball clock, marshmallow sofa and the pole-supported wall-storage system. Nelson also designed numerous exhibitions, including the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, and the Chrysler Corporation display at the 1964 New York World`s Fair.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

During the war, Bertoia worked with Charles and Ray Eames at the Evans Products Company in California, developing new techniques for molding plywood. \n \nBertoia designed the patented Diamond chair for Knoll in 1952. As a furniture designer, Bertoia is best known for the Diamond chair and the Bird chair, a high-backed model developed from the Diamond chair that looks like a bird with spread wings. Its organic, human-friendly form helped to create a new look for modernism. All of his work bears the hallmarks of a highly skilled and imaginative sculptor, as well as an inventive designer, deeply engaged with the relationship between form and space. \n \nHarry Bertoia received awards from the American Institute of Architects in 1973 and the American Academy of Letters in 1975.",

Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies starting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of California, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch Gordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and Drexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association with Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted until his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design, extolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and helping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.",

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

True nomadic rugs such as the Gabbeh are almost exclusively knotted for personal use, and often the woman\"s spirit and natural artisanship are quite apparent in these personal interpretations of their life in art. \n\nAnother characteristic of Gabbeh rugs is a very thick pile, woven in a relatively low knot density. Designs are typically geometric and symbolic in shape and style. Gabbeh weavers may be telling a story, depicting a landscape or scene, or even conveying an emotion. Most commonly Gabbeh will be asymmetric and woven to tell a story, with figures and symbols depicting parts of the weaver\"s \"tale\". It is this subjective and random process that renders a genuine Gabbeh a completely unique work of art, distinct from other Persian rugs and from many other types of weaving or knotting in general.",

Accordingly, he works each item of furniture from the drawing board, through his own shop where he handled the raw materials directly, to actual use in his New York home with wife, Charlotte, and two young sons. As a partner in Post Modern, Ltd., which manufactured from his designs. Arthur had a hand in producing, merchandising, and selling, too. \n\nSome of his most interesting pieces are those which combine wrought iron and wood or laminated plastic: well sized desk (36x24x45), in birch, walnut or Formica; combination lamp table and magazine rack in the same materials. \n\nHis most recognizable early work designs were for Shaver Howard. \n\nUmanoff`s work for Elton continues with the introduction of chairs, serving carts and a complete line of case pieces which get Elton and Umanoff chosen for the 1953 Good Design Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. \n\nThe Umanoff designs for Elton (1953) were also featured for the 1954 Storage: Volume 4 of the Interiors Library series edited by George Nelson.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Evans had a two-man show in 1961 at America House, an exhibition held at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York (now named the Museum of Arts & Design). In 1964, Evans became a featured designer for furniture manufacturer Directional Furniture. With Directional Furniture, Paul Evans introduced several series of furniture lines; such as Argente series, Sculpted Bronze series, Sculptured and Painted Steel, Patchwork Copper, Pewter and Brass, and the popular Cityscape series. \n\nEvans pieces were frequently signed, and some of the custom items have a signature and a date. Paul Evans combination of handcraft and technology anticipated the limited edition art furniture of today.

Long fascinated by the relationship between materials, technology, design, and function -- and given to flights of insightful socio-cultural and philosophical musings -- Kramer is recognized as one of the greatest industrial designers of our age. A graduate of the renowned engineering program at Chicago\"s Institute of Design, his achievements were myriad. Kramer devised the first truly ergonomic chair in 1946; began conceiving radically new truck designs in the early-1950s; started teaching Industrial Design at the University of Washington in 1957 and architecture workshops at the University of Oregon in 1960. In 1966 the American Institute of Architects (AIA) honored his \"outstanding achievement in fine arts, allied professions, [and] craftsmanship in the industrial arts\" by bestowing on him their coveted Industrial Arts Medal. \nKramer\"s probable greatest claim to fame was his famous and award-winning ION chair. An icon of mid-century modern furniture design, the ultra-ergonomic chair was a result of his philosophic approach to design. As Kramer told The Seattle Times in 1966, the design came about because he simply viewed the act of sitting as a \"dynamic rather than static condition.\"",

Risom described the chair as \"very basic, very simple, inexpensive, easy to make.\" The chair was constructed with a birch wood frame and, because of wartime materials constraints, cheap but strong army surplus webbing and has inspired countless imitations. \n\nRisom continued to create simple, well-crafted modern furniture with Knoll and George Jensen, but established his own design studio, Jens Risom Design, in 1946. The studio was acquired by Dictaphone in 1970 and in 1973, Risom became chief executive of Design Control, a Connecticut based design consultancy. \n\nIn the 1970`s, he acted as a trustee of the Rhode Island School of design. Now in his eighties, Jens Risom continues to be active and his work continues to reflect the Danish approach to modernism, with its emphasis on traditional values and the human need for warmth, beauty and simplicity. Modern American design owes much to his unfailing sense of proportion, commitment to practicality and insight into the forms of modern living.",

Her dinnerware combines a craft-based heritage with modern lines in a way that has been prized by many. \nIn 1941, Brian Heath became regional director for the American Red Cross and the couple moved to San Francisco. On the drive to the West Coast, they stopped in New Mexico, where Edith Heath would make an important discovery. The work of one of the most influential Native American potters – Maria Martinez – captivated Heath and she knew at that moment that ceramics was the work she wanted to pursue. \nIn 1944, The California Palace of the Legion of Honor hosted a one-woman show of Heath\"s work. This exhibit led to a meeting with a buyer for Gump\"s and Heath was soon making dinnerware sets for the San Francisco retailer. Two years later, Heath was one of ten artists invited to exhibit her work at the San Francisco Gift Show, where she met Nelson Gustin, who offered to represent her work nationwide and guarantee to purchase a year\"s output. Heath Ceramics was born. \nIn 1947, Edith and Brian purchased the space in Sausalito, California where Heath Ceramics is still located today. Operated by new owners Robin Petravic and Catherine Bailey since 2003, Heath Ceramics is one of the few mid-century American potteries still in existence.",

Soon production was taken over by Herman Miller, Inc ., who continues to produce the furniture in the United States to this day. Another company, Vitra International , manufactures the furniture in Europe. The Eameses continued to create new furniture designs into the 1970s.\n\nExamples include the molded plastic or fiberglass chairs from the early 1950s and the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman from 1956.

Though a sculptor and grounded in traditional handicrafts, he quickly established a career as an industrial designer. From the mid-1950s his tableware and kitchenware designs became synonymous with Scandinavian modern and found their way into millions of homes in the USA, Europe and Japan. With his international orientation and success he was groundbreaking, and he had great significance for the place which Danish design acquired in the minds of many Americans. In 1958 he received the Neiman Marcus Award and during the following years he was represented at major museums in Europe and the USA. Many of Jens Quistgaards works are still produced today.",

Clients include Artemide, Allessi and IBM. He designed the Lambda chair in conjunction with Marro Zanusso.
