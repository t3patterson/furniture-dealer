            <p class="answer">A: Metro Retro started in 2000 as an online store providing designer furniture and accessories for thousands of customers through eBay.

            <p>We feature vintage items from Herman Miller, Jens Risom, Knoll, and Dunbar.

            <p class="question">Q: How does Metro Retro rate the condition of furniture?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: Most of our pieces are vintage (30+ year old) furniture. Condition will vary. A little bruising on chair and table legs is normal wear for furniture of that age. We will point out more-than-normal bruising on a piece, however.</p>
            <p>Metro Retro uses the following condition ratings:</p>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Mint</th>
                        <td>The piece looks like it came off a showroom floor. It has all of its original finish, with original luster and no wear or flaking. There are no nicks, gouges, or scratches. Any discoloration is from the manufacturer and not a later stain.</td>
                    </tr>

                        <th>Excellent</th>
                        <td>Nearly showroom perfect with one or two superficial blemishes. Overall appearance is not affected by blemishes. Piece may be refinished. We will note in the description if it has been refinished or reupholstered.</td>

                        <td>Showing some signs of age. Superficial surface scratches and blemishes are more visible than Excellent. Finish may have minor flaking but the piece is otherwise presentable. A good cleaning or polishing will improve appearance.</td>
